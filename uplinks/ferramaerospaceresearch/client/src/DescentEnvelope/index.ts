/**
 * The aero model's own descent envelope, as a CONTRIBUTED PLOT.
 *
 * A velocity-height instrument: speed across, height above ground up, the
 * ground at the bottom edge. Every statement a full-fidelity aerodynamics model
 * makes about a descent is a statement about a point or a curve in exactly that
 * plane, which is why the model's reading belongs on a plot at all rather than
 * in another row of numbers.
 *
 * It has been three things. It was a React overlay bound to a
 * `landing-status.envelope` augment slot, drawing its own `<svg>` in a
 * coordinate space the host handed it. Then it was a set of marks contributed
 * INTO the host's plot. It is now a plot of its own, contributed to `plots`,
 * because drawing into somebody else's instrument is not something the
 * framework offers: an author contributes a whole plot or nothing.
 *
 * The visible cost of that is honest and worth stating: the model's curve and
 * the back-out curve it disagrees with are on THIS plot now, beside the host's
 * own envelope rather than on it, so an operator with FAR installed sees two
 * envelopes. What it buys is that the two models are never silently blended
 * into one picture whose provenance you cannot read, and that nothing here
 * knows a pixel or a host: this file states metres and metres per second
 * against a frame it declared itself.
 *
 * Two marks, and each answers a question the first-party plot cannot:
 *
 * - **the model's own TERMINAL VELOCITY becomes a second curve**, and the
 *   descent is re-run against it. The first-party curve is a back-out from
 *   measured drag that assumes the drag coefficient holds all the way down,
 *   which is exactly what the transonic drag rise breaks. Where the two curves
 *   separate, the plot's own projection is soft, and the model's settle tick
 *   says at what height the vessel will actually be slow. That is the entry
 *   question, and BALLISTIC COEFFICIENT is the number that sets the answer, so
 *   it is written on the tick rather than parked in a readout.
 * - **a STALL word at the plot's edge** once the wing starts to depart, because
 *   that is the one aerodynamic event that changes what the pilot does next and
 *   an operator watching the plot must not have to look elsewhere for it.
 *
 * ANGLE OF ATTACK is deliberately NOT on the plot, and the reasoning is worth
 * keeping: the plot already spends screen DIRECTION on (delta-v, delta-h), which
 * is exactly what the predicted trace is, so any glyph rotated in the plot's own
 * frame competes with the trace leaving it. Alpha is a badge, where a number in
 * a fixed place is read as a number.
 *
 * Absence is drawn as absence throughout. With no reading for this vessel the
 * contribution says so and adds no marks; with `aeroModelValid` false every mark
 * it does add is faint and dashed, because after a staging or a deployment the
 * coefficients still describe the previous shape. Neither state is ever a zero.
