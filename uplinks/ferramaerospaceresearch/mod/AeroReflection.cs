// Reflection-only bridge to Ferram Aerospace Research. No compile-time reference
// to FerramAerospaceResearch.dll exists anywhere in this project: every FAR
// member is reached by runtime reflection, the same arm's-length pattern every
// third-party-mod Uplink here uses, and the reason is the same. FAR's
// LICENSE file is not machine-classifiable and the mod is widely understood to
// be copyleft-family, so this assembly USES the running mod rather than
// INCORPORATING any of it. FAR's attribution notice is retained in
// NOTICE-FAR.txt alongside this file.
//
// Member names are RESOLVED, not guessed: every one below was read out of an
// ilspycmd 11.0 disassembly of the installed FerramAerospaceResearch.dll,
// FAR v0.16.1.2. What that reading established, and why the shape here follows
// from it:
//
//   - FlightGUI is a VesselModule, so it is reachable from the vessel's own
//     vesselModules list. FARAPI's VesselFlightInfo(v) goes through a static
//     Dictionary<Vessel, FlightGUI> instead; walking the modules avoids both the
//     generic dictionary lookup and any dependence on that static's lifetime,
//     and gets the same object
//   - FlightGUI.InfoParameters is a public VesselFlightInfo property with a
//     private setter, written unconditionally in FlightGUI.FixedUpdate from
//     PhysicsCalcs.UpdatePhysicsParameters. It is NOT gated on any FAR window
//     being open, so it is current every physics tick whether or not the
//     operator has FAR's own display up. That is what makes a plain read of it
//     legitimate rather than a poll of something only a repaint refreshes
//   - VesselFlightInfo is a plain struct of public double fields. Reading it
//     boxes once per capture and every field read is a field read on the box
//   - FARVesselAero.HasValidVoxelizationCurrently() is the voxelisation
//     qualifier. Its body is three field tests and a negation: no logging, no
//     native call, no allocation
//
// TWO METHODS ARE INVOKED, and both were read before being called, per the rule
// in docs/creating-an-uplink.md ("a field read is safe, a call is safe only once
// you have read its body"):
//
//   AirspeedSettingsGUI.CalculateIAS()
//     -> FARAeroUtil.RayleighPitotTubeStagPressure(mach), pure arithmetic over
//        FARAeroUtil.CurrentAdiabaticIndex
//     -> FARAtmosphere.GetPressure(vessel), a DelegateDispatcher whose Invoke
//        catches every exception and falls back to the stock body pressure,
//        logging at info level. Nothing on the path is fatal
//   AirspeedSettingsGUI.CalculateEAS()
//     -> FARAeroUtil.GetCurrentDensity(vessel), a loop over the vessel's parts
//        reading stock per-part dynamic pressure. No FAR logging at all
//
// Neither reaches FARLogger.Error or any Fatal equivalent, and neither mutates
// anything. Both can still return a non-finite double, and AeroCapture is where
// that is dealt with rather than here.
//
// Fail-soft throughout: a member FAR has moved degrades to absence, never a
// throw. A capture that throws takes its owning Uplink inert from the next tick,
// so a FAR update must cost this Uplink its readings and nothing more.
