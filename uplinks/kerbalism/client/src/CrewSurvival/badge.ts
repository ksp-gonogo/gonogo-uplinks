// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// CrewStatus's panel badge (mirrors `ShipSystems/badge.ts`'s
// `ship-systems-badge`): a pure contribution to the widget's auto-wired
// `crew-status.badges` slot, the collapsed-header `panelBadges` row. The
// widget-authored per-row AugmentSlot is deliberately a DIFFERENT string,
// `crew-status.row-badges`: one name across two registries renders in two
// places on screen and leaves an author no way to tell which they bound.
// Fed by the SAME `CREW_SURVIVAL` Processor `index.tsx`'s per-row augment
// reads: one per-frame evaluation, two consumers.
//
// States the condition at VESSEL level ("Crew critical" / "2 crew
// critical"), never a specific kerbal's name: the header has room for one
// line, and a name-dropping badge would need to change shape the moment a
// second kerbal joins the danger band. Fires only in the danger band
// (`tone === "nogo"`, the same threshold the per-row badge in `index.tsx`'s
// `warningFor` uses for an imminent death clock or a rule past its critical
// fraction): a merely-elevated ("warn") crew is already flagged per-kerbal by
// the `.survival` meter's own colour, so the header stays quiet for that
// case and reserves itself for what actually threatens someone. Returns null
// when nobody is critical, so a nominal vessel carries no header clutter.
