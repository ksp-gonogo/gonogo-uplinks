/**
 * The reckoned band, on the meter it is about.
 *
 * `crewReckoning.ts` mints a genuine `sigma1` interval per moving accumulator
 * in the accumulator's OWN unit, and the bar it belongs on is drawn as a
 * fraction of the rule's fatal threshold. So this file is about the trip
 * between those two: that the interval reaches the meter at all, that it
 * arrives on the axis the track is drawn on, and that a rule the model
 * declined to bound carries a figure and no interval rather than an invented
 * one.
 *
 * Every fixture spaces its samples irregularly, for the reason
 * `crewReckoning.test.ts` gives: the stream is change-gated, so a topic carries
 * a point when its value changed and at no other time.
