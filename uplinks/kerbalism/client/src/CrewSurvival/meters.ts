// Per-kerbal survival meters, as DATA.
//
// This was `CrewSurvivalAugment`, a React component bound to a
// `crew-status.survival` augment slot, and its entire render was a `Stack` of
// `Meter` and nothing else: zero pixels CrewStatus did not already own. The
// test for which mechanism a slot wants is whether the host already has chrome
// for what the extension draws, and for a stack of labelled 0..1 bars it plainly
// does.
//
// As a contribution the host gets back what an augment could never give it: it
// can count what arrived, order it, and lay it out with its own rows. And the
// rows are the point, `row` carries the kerbal's name, which is exactly what
// let a per-row extension stop being a bespoke widget slot at all.
//
// A SECOND augment went the same way, for the same reason. The crew model's
// uncertainty interval used to be printed as text on the roster row, beside
// the very bar it was an interval about, because a `Meter` took a bare number
// and had nowhere to put a second end. It takes a whole `Reading` now and
// draws the interval as marks on its own track, so the band is zero pixels
// this stack did not already own. `./ruleReadings` is what carries it here.
