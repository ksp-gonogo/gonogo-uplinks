// Per-kerbal Kerbalism survival: dose/stress/etc rule state plus a death
// clock, derived once per frame off the vessel's real crew roster
// (`vessel.crew`, the same identity source CrewStatus itself renders) joined
// against Kerbalism's own per-kerbal rule accumulators (`kerbalism.crew`).
//
// It belongs HERE, in the Kerbalism Uplink's own Processor, and not inline in
// CrewStatus (`packages/components`), which would contaminate the vanilla base
// widget with a Kerbalism-specific read. Consumed by the
// `crew-status.meters` contribution (meters.ts),
// the per-row badge augment (index.tsx)
// and the panel badge (badge.ts): one per-frame derivation, two consumers,
// same dogfood pattern as `SHIP_SYSTEMS`/`ship-systems-badge`.
//
// Joins by NAME: it is the only identity both `vessel.crew.crew[]`
// (`CrewMember`) and `kerbalism.crew[]` (`KerbalismCrewEntry`) carry in
// common. A kerbal absent from `kerbalism.crew` (no Kerbalism data reported
// for them yet, or the mod not installed) still gets a roster entry here
// with no rules, so a consumer can render "stable" rather than nothing.
//
// Deliberately does NOT derive the shared "time to life-support depletion"
// cross-resource clock from
// `kerbalism.lifesupport`/`kerbalism.profile`/`vessel.resources`: that is Ship
// Systems' own domain (`summarise`/`timeToEmptySeconds` in `../ecosystem`), and
// deriving it here too would be a second derivation of the same fact.
// `deathClockSec` below is read straight off the wire's own
// `KerbalismCrewEntry.deathClockSec`, which the mod fills in: it is the
// soonest FATAL rule, and only the mod can compute it because its first stage
// needs resource amounts that no per-craft channel carries. Null still means
// not derivable and must keep rendering differently from a long deadline.
