// Each survival rule's 0..1 figure AS A READING: how current it is, and how
// well the crew model knows it.
//
// This was an augment. `crewReckoning.ts` is the one model in this tree that
// mints a real uncertainty interval, and `CrewSurvival`'s Processor flattens
// each rule to a bare `fraction`, which has nowhere to put the second end. So
// the interval used to be drawn as TEXT on the roster row, beside a meter that
// was already drawing the number it bounds, and the operator rejected that
// picture twice.
//
// `Meter` now takes a whole `Reading` and draws the band itself, one mark per
// bound on the track the bar is already on, so the second end has somewhere to
// go that is not a second row. What was missing between the model and the
// meter is this: a contribution is handed its Topic deps as PAYLOADS and never
// as readings (`DepValue` in the sdk says so), so nothing downstream of the
// Processor could see a reckoning at all.
//
// ## Why a Processor may hand back a `Reading` here
//
// `ReadingDep`'s own doc says a Processor should not return one, and gives the
// reason: a `Reading` is ONE Topic's currency, and a conclusion drawn across
// several is not any single Topic's anything. That is the test, and this is
// inside it. Every figure here is one field of `kerbalism.crew` divided by
// another field of the same rule of the same Topic, so its currency and its
// model are exactly that Topic's. Nothing from `vessel.crew` reaches these
// numbers; the roster only supplies names, and it does that next door.
