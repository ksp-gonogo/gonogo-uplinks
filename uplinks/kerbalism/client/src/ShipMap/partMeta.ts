// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The Kerbalism `ship-map.part-meta` contribution: per-part status rows for
// things that aren't a fill-level meter. Today the ONLY real per-part
// granularity on the wire is a fitted process's running/broken/idle state
// (`KerbalismLifeSupport.processes[].flightId`), so that's all this emits.
//
// Habitat pressure, radiation dose, and reliability MTBF are named in the
// design plan as the eventual `ship-map.part-meta` payload, but NONE of them
// are on the wire with per-part granularity today:
//   - `KerbalismLifeSupport.habitat` is one vessel-wide aggregate, not
//     per-part. Attaching it to every crewed part would fabricate a
//     distinct-per-part reading that doesn't exist.
//   - Radiation dose is per-CREW (a `KerbalismCrewEntry` rule), not per-part.
//   - There is no MTBF/failure-rate field on the wire at all;
//     `KerbalismFeatures.reliability` is only a boolean feature flag.
// This is real debt: extending the wire contract to carry these is a mod-
// side change (Sitrep.Contract + a full mod sln test pass), out of scope for
// this pass. Flagged rather than faked with a fabricated per-part number.
