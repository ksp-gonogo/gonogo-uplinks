/**
 * Greenhouse section, the built-in filler for the `ship-systems.life-support`
 * augment slot (see `ShipSystems/index.tsx`'s slot doc comment). Registered as
 * an ordinary augment rather than baked into the host body so a future
 * non-Kerbalism life-support source can leave the slot empty with no code
 * change on either side, matching every other `*.sections` slot's contract.
 *
 * Renders ONLY the fields Kerbalism's own `Greenhouse.Data` class actually
 * carries (`natural`, `artificial`, `issue`) plus the part's persisted
 * `active` toggle and its derived continuous food-production rate. There is
 * deliberately NO growth meter and NO time-to-harvest countdown anywhere in
 * this file, neither concept exists in the module (production is
 * continuous via a ResourceRecipe, not a discrete harvest event); grounded
 * against `src/Kerbalism/Modules/Greenhouse.cs`.
 *
 * `natural` and `artificial` are NEVER summed or combined into one figure:
 * the real lighting gate is `natural + artificial >= light_tolerance`, so a
 * lamp only ever needs to cover the shortfall against the sun, not double
 * the total. Presenting a combined number would misrepresent that as "more
 * light is always better," when a bright lamp on an already-lit greenhouse
 * contributes nothing the sun wasn't already providing.
 *
 * NOT YET fed by live data: `GonogoKerbalismUplink`'s capture pipeline does
 * not populate `kerbalism.lifesupport.greenhouses` yet, see
 * `KerbalismLifeSupport.Greenhouses`'s own doc comment in
 * `mod/Sitrep.Contract/KerbalismPayloads.cs`. This section is wired and
 * fixture-tested against the wire shape now so the mod-side capture has
 * something real to land into; on an unmodified Kerbalism install today the
 * field arrives as `undefined`, the widget's own `useLifeSupport`/processor
 * treats that as "no greenhouse fitted," and this component's early return
 * means the slot renders nothing, exactly like a vessel with no greenhouse
 * part.
 *
 * Lives inside the Uplink (not `@ksp-gonogo/components`): life support is a
 * Kerbalism concept and never belonged in the base component library. This
 * file moved here alongside the Ship Systems rebuild, replacing the deleted
 * `packages/components/src/LifeSupportSystems/` widget, which owned this
 * augment before.
