// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The radiation graph + belt/location readout, piece of the Ship Systems
// widget (see `index.tsx`'s render site). Fed straight off the
// `kerbalism.spaceweather` Topic: no Processor, same "nothing else shares
// this derivation" reasoning `SpaceWeather/badge.ts` and `CrewSurvival/
// summary.tsx` already use for the same Topic.
//
// The whole point of the two-line pairing is the GAP between them: ambient
// (`radiationRadPerSecond`) is what the environment is doing, shielded
// (`habitatRadiationRadPerSecond`) is what actually reaches the crew after
// the vessel's fixed shielding factor. A wide gap with shielded pinned under
// the threshold marker reads as "ambient is spiking, shielding is doing its
// job"; a gap that closes reads as "shielding isn't enough anymore".
// Per-kerbal lines are deliberately never drawn here: the rate itself is
// vessel-wide (Kerbalism's habitat radiation is a property of the vessel's
// shielding, not of any one Kerbal), see this widget's own doc comment / the
// task this was built against.
//
// The series wear IDENTITY hues at rest (ambient the muted text grey,
// shielded the calm info blue), never alarm colours: a permanently-red
// ambient trace shouted CRITICAL through every quiet cruise (operator
// feedback, the widget's own worst colour offender). Status enters only
// when a line's CURRENT reading crosses the 0.5 rad/h threshold: ambient
// escalates to warning amber (the environment is hot, shielding still
// deciding the outcome), shielded to nogo red (the crew is actually taking
// dose). The paired readouts below the graph escalate in step so colour
// never carries the reading alone.
//
// Renders as a SPARKLINE (`LineGraph`'s `variant="sparkline"`), not an
// engineering chart: operator feedback on the first pass called the plain
// `LineGraph` too technical for what is meant to be a glance-read trend.
// Area-shaded lines, no gridlines, still the same two series plus the
// safe-threshold marker. This is also the widget's LEAD section now
// (rendered first in `index.tsx`'s body), the attractive visual earns the
// top slot rather than being buried below the resource ledger.
//
// OPEN, not boxed: a second round of operator feedback called the graph too
// chart-like still, partly because it sat inside a `Card` (a boxy container
// that reads as "yet another gauge" in a widget that is already box-after-
// box) and only took a fraction of the row's width beside the belt badges.
// The `Card` wrapper is gone; the graph now spans the widget's FULL width
// and breathes on the Panel's own background, the way a sparkline is meant
// to sit inline with surrounding text rather than fenced off in its own
// instrument housing.
//
// The belt/location badges are gone too: belt membership is a neutral
// status fact (which magnetic zone the vessel is in right now), not an
// alert, so a red "Inner belt" pill was miscommunicating severity that
// belongs to the dose-rate readouts, not the location. It renders as plain
// low-emphasis text under the graph instead (see `locationLabel` below).
//
// The 0.5 rad/h boundary draws as a FIXED ~24px tick at the frame's left
// edge with the "0.5" level beside it (`LineGraph`'s
// `thresholdStyle="marker"`), an axis annotation rather than a rule: a
// full-width dashed line made the boundary the loudest thing in the frame,
// and the earlier centred marker stretched with the viewBox so its length
// changed with every widget width. The muted warning amber carries "this is
// the danger level" quietly.
//
// The Y domain is CLAMPED to a 1-2-2.5-5-10 nice ceiling (never below twice
// the threshold), instead of hugging the live data extent: an extent-fitted
// domain rescaled the whole frame on every sample, so the threshold marker
// and both traces crawled continuously, the live jank operators called out.
// With the clamp the frame is still until a trace actually crosses into the
// next step.
