/**
 * A resource the PROFILE declares and the CRAFT has no tank for.
 *
 * `ResourceRow.fraction` is declared `number | null` and says what null means:
 * the vessel carries no tank for that resource. The profile belongs to the
 * INSTALL, not to the craft, so a probe flying three of the twelve resources a
 * profile declares is the ordinary case rather than an edge one. Every meter
 * for a resource with no tank was drawn as a bar sitting at zero, which says
 * the tank is empty rather than that there is no tank, and the pinned "Power"
 * footer is the one readout on this widget an operator acts on immediately.
 *
 * The habitat block next door was already fixed for exactly this and tested for
 * it (`index.test.tsx`'s "habitat readings that never arrived"); the resource,
 * wear and power meters were left behind by that pass.
 *
 * <b>Its own FILE, not another describe in `index.test.tsx`.</b> The timeline
 * store outlives one `setupStreamFixture`, so a `vessel.resources` sample an
 * earlier test wrote at that file's pinned UT wins over the partial-tank one
 * emitted here: written as a describe, both assertions below passed against the
 * full-tank fixture and went on passing with the coercion restored. Vitest
 * isolates per file, which the shared store makes load-bearing rather than
 * incidental.
