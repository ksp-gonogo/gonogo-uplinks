/**
 * A ProcessController the mod could see but could not READ.
 *
 * `running` and `broken` are both `bool?` on the contract and the mod stopped
 * flattening them, so a scrubber whose module fields moved arrives with neither
 * flag. The row's state came off a truthiness ladder that had no third rung, so
 * it rendered "idle": a plant that is fitted, intact and switched off, which an
 * operator fixes by reaching for a toggle rather than by looking closer. The
 * header fraction counted it among the not-running too.
 *
 * Its own FILE for the same reason `noTank.test.tsx` is: the timeline store
 * outlives one `setupStreamFixture`, so a `kerbalism.lifesupport` sample from
 * another file's describe wins over the one emitted here.
