 * moves. So the overlay is not decoration here: it is the difference between a
 * mark drawn where the craft is and one drawn where it was when the link last
 * delivered.
 *
 * Every case below therefore reads the mark's POSITION rather than snapshotting
 * the board. Dropping the overlay leaves a widget that still renders, still
 * draws a mark and still matches a snapshot: it just puts the craft 1400 km
 * lower than it is, which is the substitution the whole reckoning design exists
