/**
 * What SpaceWeather does when its readings stop being current.
 *
 * The decision: it keeps the board and withholds the VERDICTS on it. A green
 * "Sheltered" pill is a statement about the habitat now, and a craft that has
 * since flown into a belt would keep wearing it for as long as the link stayed
 * down, so the pill, the storm reassurance, the lit belt rings and the "you are
 * here" dot all go. The dose rate, the shielding pair, the stars and the CMEs
 * are measurements and timeline facts, so they stay, dated.
 *
 * This file previously asserted the opposite, that the whole board was
 * withheld. That half is rewritten rather than deleted, and the case that
 * earned it survives intact one test down: the verdict must still not persist.
 *
 * The other assertions that earn this file are the ones about the REASON, since
 * a widget that draws nothing satisfies almost every test ever written about
 * it. Each case below checks which of the reasons it is: dated, confirmed to
 * have no data, or not yet arrived. All three used to render the same fabricated
 * board, and none may render another's wording.
