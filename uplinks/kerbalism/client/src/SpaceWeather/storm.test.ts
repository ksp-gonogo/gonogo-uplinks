/**
 * The CME derivation on a frame with no view clock.
 *
 * `useViewUt()` is `undefined` with no provider mounted, before the first
 * confirmed sample, and through the resynchronizing state after a rewind, so a
 * clockless frame is ordinary rather than exotic. The widget used to answer it
 * with `magnitudeOr(useViewUt(), 0)`, which measured every CME against UT 0: a
 * storm 80 seconds away reported an ETA of the storm time itself, stated to the
 * second, and a transit bar pinned at its start. Both are claims the save never
 * made, and both are asserted absent below.
 *
 * The two fields that do NOT depend on the clock stay readable in the same
 * frame, which is the point of taking them separately: a missing clock costs
 * the operator the ETA and the progress, not the whole card.
