/**
 * What SpaceWeather DOES today when its telemetry reads are `undefined`,
 * recorded before `useTelemetry` becomes a `Reading`.
 *
 * `useSpaceWeather` has no absence gate at all. Every one of its reads is
 * coerced at the point of use:
 *  - `magnitudeOr(t?.radiationRadPerSecond, 0)` and
 *    `magnitudeOr(flight?.altitudeAsl, 0)`: absent becomes ZERO
 *  - `t?.innerBelt ?? false`, `outerBelt`, `magnetosphere`, `blackout`: absent
 *    becomes FALSE
 *  - `magnitudeOr(t?.shieldingCapacity, 1)`: absent becomes ONE
 *  - `t?.stormInProgress ? ... : t?.stormIncoming ? ... : "none"`: absent falls
 *    through to "no storm"
 *
 * So the widget renders a full, confident board from nothing at all, and every
 * assertion here records a fabricated number rather than a placeholder. There is
 * no `undefined`-shaped branch anywhere in the file for the migration to
 * preserve, which is exactly the risk: nothing will look different afterwards
 * either.
 *
 * It does look different afterwards. Three of the cases below now record the
 * migrated behaviour instead, each keeping the sentence it replaced: the board is
 * withheld when the weather record cannot be judged, and the belt diagram's
 * "you are here" dot is withheld when nothing can place it. The two cases about
 * a FIELD missing from a delivered record still record the old coercions, because
 * a `Reading` says how current the record is and says nothing about which fields
 * the subject filled in.
