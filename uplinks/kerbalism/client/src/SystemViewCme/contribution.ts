// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// CME / solar-activity overlay: a `system-view.entities` contribution off
// `kerbalism.spaceweather`, the same shape-contribution seam the built-in
// vessel-orbit and CommNet-graph entries ride (`SystemView/
// vesselOrbitsContribution.ts`). One yellow `travelling-pulse` per active
// storm slot, so SystemView renders it without knowing Kerbalism exists.
//
// `KerbalismSpaceWeather.storms` is scoped to the ACTIVE VESSEL's current SOI
// body: one entry per (that body, star) pair (`Storm.StormKey`), so at most
// one entry per star in a single-star system, a handful in a modded
// binary/trinary one. A storm with `stormState === 0` carries no
// `stormTime`/`stormDuration`/`dist` (Kerbalism's own `StormData.Reset()`
// zeroes them) and is skipped outright, never drawn from a fabricated
// position.
//
// HONESTY NOTE on the travelling pulse's geometry: a CME is a targeted mass
// ejection from ONE point on the star travelling in ONE direction, not a
// spherical front (an earlier version drew a `blob`, a concentric circle,
// purely because that was the only directional-less shape available; a
// later version drew a decorative, endlessly looping CSS animation, which
// read as multiple repeating waves rather than one real event). This
// contribution supplies only what IS real: the bearing (below), the
// segment's LENGTH, and the real UT window it occupies; SystemView owns
// turning that into a single, non-looping pass positioned each render
// against its own live UT (`systemEntities.ts`'s doc comment on
// `travelling-pulse`, `SystemEntitiesLayer.tsx`'s `Primitive` case), a
// contribution's `compute()` never receives a wall clock itself
// (contribution-slots-spec: pure function of Topics/Processors only, see
// `contributions.ts`'s own doc comment).
//
// The segment's length is `stormEjectionSpeed * stormDuration` (clamped to
// `dist`): the physical distance the ejecta covers, at its real ejection
// speed, over the real span the storm stays active at the target body,
// `stormDuration`. The UT window is `arriveUt` (Kerbalism's own
// `stormTime`, the storm's arrival) through `clearUt` (`arriveUt +
// stormDuration`, when the trailing edge fully clears the target):
// SystemView derives the wave's DEPARTURE time itself from these two plus
// the segment's own length, at the one constant real rate that already
// makes the crossing phase take exactly `stormDuration`. A storm entry with
// no resolvable duration, ejection speed, or arrival UT is skipped outright,
// the same "no data, no draw" discipline every other field on this entity
// already follows, rather than a fabricated segment or a fabricated time.
//
// The bearing: `KerbalismSpaceWeather.stars` carries each star's
// vessel-to-star unit `direction` (`VesselData.SunInfo.Direction`), captured
// on the same reflection pass as the storm slot itself, so a star entry is
// always present alongside a storm entry for that star. Negating it gives a
// star-to-vessel bearing, a fair stand-in for star-to-body (the vessel sits
// inside that body's SOI, negligible next to interplanetary `dist`). This
// bearing carries all three components: SystemView's arithmetic is
// three-dimensional and its third component is out of the ecliptic, which is
// the game's own `y`. A storm with no matching `stars` entry (defensive: the two
// lists come off the same reflection loop, so this shouldn't happen in
// practice) is skipped outright rather than drawn with a fabricated bearing.
//
// Colour: always the shared yellow token (`--color-tag-yellow-fg`, the same
// one `ThermalStatus`'s "warm" state and `ShipMap`'s highlight already use),
// deliberately distinct from the muted warning tokens and from the accent
// green SystemView reserves for selection. `stormState`
// distinguishes inbound (faint) from arrived (normal emphasis, the same
// yellow) so the pulse shows the storm progressing between those two real,
// known states without changing hue.
