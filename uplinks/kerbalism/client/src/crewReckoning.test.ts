/**
 * Carrying a kerbal's survival accumulators forward at the rate they are
 * OBSERVED to be moving, not at the rate the profile declares.
 *
 * `KerbalismCrewRule` publishes both, side by side, and the declared one is a
 * trap: `degenPerSec` is a config constant off `Profile.rules[].degeneration`,
 * and the contract says in terms that "a rule only degenerates once its input
 * resource is gone". Integrating it unconditionally would kill a perfectly
 * healthy kerbal on schedule. The declared window is what makes the honest
 * version possible: two samples of `value` are the rate that is ACTUALLY
 * happening, and a flat pair says the rule is not degenerating at all.
 *
 * Every fixture spaces its samples irregularly. The stream is change-gated, so
 * a topic carries a point when its value changed and at no other time, and
 * nothing here may depend on a fixed interval.
