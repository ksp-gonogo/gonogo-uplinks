/**
 * A kerbal's survival accumulators, carried forward at the rate they are
 * OBSERVED to be moving.
 *
 * ## Why not the rate the profile declares
 *
 * `KerbalismCrewRule` publishes the accumulator and a rate side by side, which
 * is the shape a rate integration wants, and taking the published rate would
 * be wrong. `degenPerSec` is a CONFIGURATION CONSTANT off
 * `Profile.rules[].degeneration`, and `KerbalismCrewEntry.deathClockUt`'s own
 * doc states the condition it omits: "a rule only degenerates once its input
 * resource is gone". So the declared rate is what the rule WOULD do while
 * starved, not what it is doing, and a model integrating it would advance a
 * perfectly supplied kerbal towards their fatal threshold on schedule. That is
 * a modelled rate presented as an observation, which is the failure the whole
 * reckoning type exists to prevent.
 *
 * The declared window is what makes the honest version possible. Two samples of
 * `value` ARE the rate that is happening, whatever the profile says, and a flat
 * pair is positive evidence that the rule is not degenerating: the input
 * resource is still aboard. `minSamples: 2` is therefore load-bearing rather
 * than decoration, and the store raises `insufficient-history` on this model's
 * behalf below it, because a slope taken from one point is not a slope.
 *
 * ## Fitted over `(stamp, value)` pairs, and the stamp is not the wire time
 *
 * The x-axis is each entry's own `asOfUt`, the UT Kerbalism last ADVANCED the
 * accumulators, not the sample's `validAt`. Unloaded craft take their Kerbalism
 * turn one per physics tick in rotation, so two consecutive wire points can
 * carry the same `asOfUt` (the craft did not take a turn between them) and the
 * accumulator is genuinely unchanged across a real interval of wire time.
 * Fitting against `validAt` would read that as a slope of zero over a gap the
 * game never simulated.
 *
 * Which also means the pairs can collapse onto ONE instant, and a slope over no
 * time is not a slope: see {@link observedSlope}.
 *
 * ## What it does not touch
 *
 * `deathClockUt` is an absolute instant the mod derived from the reading at
 * `asOfUt`, and its contract is explicit that "It is NOT restamped to now:
 * nothing is advanced, the instant is exactly the one the stamped-at reading
 * implied". Carrying it forward would move a deadline nobody moved. Every
 * sibling here (the name, the trait, the declared rate, the threshold, the
 * deadline) travels verbatim, and `modelled` names only the accumulators.
 */

/**
 * How far a degenerating accumulator stays honest, in seconds.
 *
 * Chosen rather than measured. The observed slope says the rule is starved
 * RIGHT NOW, and what ends that is the input resource coming back: a converter
 * catching up, a craft docking, a crew transfer. None of those is predictable
 * from this channel, so the horizon is a statement about how long "still
 * starved" is a safe assumption rather than a property of the arithmetic.
 *
 * Ten minutes is the round number inside that. The clamp at
 * `fatalThreshold` is the other limiter and the sharper one: past the threshold
 * the kerbal is dead and every rate here is about someone who no longer has
 * one, so the model stops rather than carrying the accumulator up into a range
 * that describes nobody.

 *
 * `null` on a degenerate x-axis is the case {@link pairsFor}'s doc is about:
 * every pair sharing one instant is not a shallow slope, it is no slope, and

 *
 * ## The standard error is the whole reason this is a fit and not a difference
 *
 * A fit has residuals, and residuals are evidence about how well the trend is
 * known. That is what lets this model offer a `sigma1` band where
 * `resourceReckoning.ts` can offer nothing: its rate is one measured sample
 * from the wire with no distribution behind it, and this one is an estimate
 * with a spread. So the window does not only make a RATE available where there
 * was none, it makes an UNCERTAINTY available, and the two arrive together
 * here so they cannot disagree.
 *
 * It is the error on the SLOPE only. The anchor the model integrates from is a
 * measurement whose own error nothing on this wire publishes, so the band this
 * feeds says how well the MODEL knows what it added, which is exactly what
 * `Reckoning.bands` is documented to mean.
