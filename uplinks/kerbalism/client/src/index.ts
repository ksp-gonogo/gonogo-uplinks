// @ksp-gonogo/gonogo-kerbalism-uplink: the KerbalismUplink client package entry.
//
// Registers the Kerbalism Domain's Topics: the bare-primitive presence gate plus
// the five structured Topics whose payload types this Uplink owns outright
// (see ./topics.ts). RE-EXPORTED rather than
// imported for side effect alone, and that is load-bearing in two ways: it keeps
// bundlers from tree-shaking the registration calls, AND it puts a real
// `export ... from "./topics"` into the built `dist/index.d.ts`, which is what
// carries topics.ts's `declare module "@ksp-gonogo/sitrep-sdk"` TopicPayloadMap
// augmentation across the package boundary. A bare `import "./topics"` is elided
// from the emitted declaration, so a consumer would silently see
// `useTelemetry("kerbalism.spaceweather")` resolve to `unknown` with nothing
// going red here (the same failure mode ui-kit's styledComponentsTheme.ts
// documents for its own augmentation).
//
// Every Kerbalism surface now lives HERE, registered through the Uplink client:
// Ship Systems (the rebuilt Life Support), Space Weather, and the augments and
// contributions that hang off the base library's slots. Life support and space
// weather are Kerbalism concepts that never belonged in a mod-agnostic widget
// library.

// This Uplink's own wire payload types: it declares them, not core. A consumer
// that reads a kerbalism.* Topic names its shape from HERE.
