// This Uplink's namespaces of the two elected `isru.*` payloads' provider extension
// bags: the typed half, which is deliberately NOT in core.
//
// `isru.*` is a Kernel-elected capability, so each channel is a single shared shape
// core declares and whichever backend won the election fills. Kerbalism WINS that
// election when installed, because its own patches delete stock's harvester and
// converter modules outright: on a Kerbalism install the stock reader walks a vessel
// and finds nothing.
//
// Unlike this Uplink's science bags, most of what Kerbalism's ISRU knows DOES have a
// stock counterpart, so the shared shape carries it and these two namespaces are
// small. Every SHARED field is filled on a Kerbalism frame, with no structural nulls
// and no value-model caveat: a Kerbalism drill's rate is in the same resource units a
// stock drill's is. What is here is only what stock has no concept of.
//
// A consuming widget imports the readers below rather than reaching into
// `entry.extensions?.kerbalism` and casting at the call site. That is the whole
// boundary: core stays open and opaque, the provider supplies the type at its own
// edge.
//
// One thing to know about the converter list under Kerbalism.
//
// Kerbalism does not distinguish an ISRU process from a life-support one: a scrubber,
// a water recycler and a Molten Regolith Electrolysis plant are the same
// `ProcessController` module running different chemistry. So `isru.converters` carries
// ALL of them, which is more rows than a stock frame has, and the same part also
// appears on `kerbalism.lifesupport`. Those are two honest views of one set of parts
// (this one the per-part converter chemistry, that one the supply and consumption
// picture), not two separate systems. Filtering here would mean gonogo asserting a
// taxonomy the engine does not draw.
