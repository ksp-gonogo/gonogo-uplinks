/**
 * The three leaves that used to be spelled like a `Reading` currency member,
 * pinned as FIELD READINGS.
 *
 * This is the assertion the rename exists for, and it is why a doc comment
 * would not do. A topic reading is `TopicCurrency<P> & TopicFields<P>`, so a
 * payload field called `value` or `asOfUt` lands on the currency's own member
 * and the intersection collapses: the field cannot be reached through the
 * reading at all, and the currency answers in its place. Reaching each of these
 * THROUGH the reading is what the old spelling made impossible, so putting the
 * old name back turns these assertions red rather than leaving them green.
