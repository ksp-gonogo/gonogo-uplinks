/**
 * Why the Ship Systems countdown is not read off the forward model over
 * `vessel.resources`.
 *
 * The two work off the same amount/rate pair, and the model corrects the level
 * for Kerbalism's own accumulator lag, which `timeToEmptySeconds` does not, so
 * it reads at a glance like the countdown should simply be taken from the
 * reckoned level. The reasons it is not are arithmetic rather than taste, and
 * they are pinned here because a survey of the two files cannot see any of
 * them: this was nominated as a duplication on exactly that reading.
 *
 * 1. **The model's LEVEL is still not a time.** A countdown taken off the
 *    reckoned level divides by the rate itself, and what the division buys is
 *    the staleness correction and nothing else. The model does now publish a
 *    time, but not that one: `resourceBoundaryCrossings` is the moment a level
 *    leaves the range it can occupy, and it is the same division off the same
 *    observed level, so taking it would not move the number. What it would buy
 *    is an ANCHOR (a UT, against seconds from a moment the widget never states)
 *    and the other end of the range, which `timeToEmptySeconds` does not cover
 * 2. **It carries no uncertainty about the rate.** `reckonResourceLevels`
 *    offers no `bandAt`, deliberately and for reasons `resourceReckoning.ts`
 *    sets out at length: the honest interval here is neither a bound nor a
 *    sigma, so there is none. A countdown off it is a point estimate, which is
 *    what the hand-rolled one already is
 * 3. **It withdraws where the widget's countdown keeps counting.** This used to
 *    be the sharpest reason and is now the weakest: the model clamped a crossed
 *    level at its boundary and went on reporting "empty NOW" on a craft whose
 *    last observation saw a full tank. It no longer does. It stops modelling
 *    that level at the crossing and hands back the observation, so what a
 *    consumer gets past the crossing is an absence plus the crossing UT, and
 *    the widget's own number is what still fills the row
 *
 * This argument was first written against `kerbalism.resourceProjection`, a
 * derived channel carrying the same model plus a two-scenario band. That
 * channel is deleted: the reckoner supersedes it, nothing ever read it, and its
 * band never became this model's, so the band arm of the argument went with it
 * and the other two are sharper without it.
