/**
 * `kerbalism.resourceProjection`: every life-support consumable, carried
 * forward from its last observed level at its last observed rate, with the
 * band that carrying implies.
 *
 * ## Why a derived channel rather than a reckoner
 *
 * Integrating a consumable needs three numbers and the contract puts them on
 * two Topics, deliberately. `vessel.resources` carries `current` and `max` for
 * every resource on the vessel; `kerbalism.lifesupport` carries `rates`, keyed
 * by the same resource name, and says why in terms: "Amounts and capacities
 * are deliberately NOT here... The rate is the one number the generic path
 * cannot derive, so it is the only one this channel adds."
 *
 * A `ReckonerFor` is handed ONE `TimelinePoint` and cannot see across that
 * split. A derived channel's `get` reaches both, pinned to one frozen view
 * time. So this is where the model lives, and the reckoning is the LABEL on
 * top of it (`deriveReckoning` below), exactly as `vessel.state` does for
 * orbital propagation.
 *
 * ## Which UT it integrates from, and it is not the wire's
 *
 * `asOfUt` is the UT Kerbalism last ADVANCED its accumulators, which for a
 * background craft can sit well behind the read time: unloaded vessels take
 * their Kerbalism turn one per tick, in rotation. So a payload can be
 * perfectly live on the wire and already minutes old as a model, and the
 * elapsed time to integrate over is `viewUt - asOfUt`, never `viewUt` minus
 * the sample's `validAt`. Two different clocks with confusingly similar names;
 * this one is the payload's.
 *
 * `asOfUt` null is a statement of ignorance the mod makes deliberately rather
 * than substituting a capture time, so a null means this channel declines to
 * project at all rather than guessing an elapsed interval.
 *
 * ## The band, and what it is NOT
 *
 * A rate was measured over some past interval and holds only while nothing
 * changes: a load shed, a process starting, a crew member waking. So a point
 * estimate rendered like an observation overstates what is known, which is why
 * `projected` never travels without `lower`/`upper`.
 *
 * The band brackets two NAMED scenarios rather than expressing a confidence
 * interval, because the wire carries exactly one rate sample and there is no
 * evidence from which to compute a distribution:
 *
 * - the rate held for the whole interval (the point estimate)
 * - the rate stopped the instant contact was lost (the level at last contact)
 *
 * Its width is therefore `|rate| * elapsed`, clamped, and it GROWS with the
 * gap. That growth is the honest difference between this and a propagated
 * orbit: a conic is as good after twenty minutes as after one, and a
 * consumable's projection is not.
 *
 * **It is not a bound on the truth.** A converter switching on can put the
 * real level outside it, and nothing on this wire would say so. It is the
 * interval an operator can reason about ("between four and ten percent"),
 * and the caveat belongs beside it in any widget that draws it.
