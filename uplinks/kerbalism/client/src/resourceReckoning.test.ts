 * Every assertion here goes through the real store: the model is asked the way
 * production asks it, through `sampleReading`, so the decline the STORE raises
 * for an absent dep is exercised alongside the ones the model raises itself.
 *
 * The interval integrated over is `viewUt - lifesupport.asOfUt`, never
 * `viewUt - point.validAt`, so the fixtures below deliberately put the two a
 * long way apart: every one of them ingests at UT 1000 and stamps the
 * accumulators at UT 900, and a model reading the wrong clock gets an answer
