/**
 * `vessel.resources`, carried forward at the net rate Kerbalism measured.
 *
 * ## Why this is a reckoner now, when the same model was a derived channel
 *
 * `resourceProjection.ts` argues at length that this model cannot be a
 * reckoner, and states its reason plainly: "A `ReckonerFor` is handed ONE
 * `TimelinePoint` and cannot see across that split." The split is real and
 * deliberate (`vessel.resources` carries amounts and capacities,
 * `kerbalism.lifesupport` carries the rates, and the latter says in terms why),
 * but a reckoner is no longer handed one point: it DECLARES its inputs and the
 * store resolves them, so the rate arrives here as a dep. So the model belongs
 * on the Topic whose value it advances, where every existing reader of that
 * Topic gets it, rather than on a parallel Topic each widget has to know to
 * read instead.
 *
 * The Uplink owns it rather than core because core cannot: `vessel.resources`
 * publishes no rate at all (its own doc defers "flow/rates (R-2/R-5)"
 * deliberately), so the only party that can advance a level is whoever models
 * the consumption. `getReckoner` elects the sole non-core owner over core's
 * vanilla for exactly this case.
 *
 * ## Which UT it integrates from, and it is not the wire's
 *
 * `asOfUt` is the UT Kerbalism last ADVANCED its accumulators, and for a
 * background craft it sits well behind the read time: unloaded vessels take
 * their Kerbalism turn one per physics tick, in rotation. So a payload can be
 * perfectly live on the wire and already minutes old as a model, and the
 * interval to integrate over is `viewUt - asOfUt`, never `viewUt` minus the
 * sample's `validAt`.
 *
 * That is also why this model does NOT follow `core-reckoners`'
 * `elapsedOrDecline` and withhold itself on a live reading. That posture is
 * right for a first-order extrapolation whose only anchor is the loss of
 * contact: on a live reading it would replace a measured value with arithmetic
 * about the same instant. Here the gap being carried is the game's own
 * accumulator lag, which exists whether or not the last packet arrived on
 * time, so `Reading`'s `{state: "observed", reckoning: "available"}` arm is
 * the one this model wants and it is there for precisely this. What it declines
 * on instead is a ZERO interval, which is the same refusal measured against
 * the right clock.
 */

/**
 * How far a net consumable rate stays honest, in seconds.
 *
 * Chosen rather than measured, and stated here as one constant so widening it
 * is a decision somebody takes rather than a number that drifts. Two things
 * inform it. A `rates` entry is a NET rate over the whole vessel, so what
 * invalidates it is a discrete event: a converter switching, a crew shift, a
 * light coming on. The shortest such event with a knowable period is the
 * orbital shadow boundary, where a craft's net electric-charge rate flips sign
 * outright, and a low orbit crosses one every twenty minutes or so.
 *
 * ## Why a band does not replace it
 *
 * `resourceProjection.ts` imposes no horizon and gives a good reason: a rate
 * does not become false at a knowable moment the way a conic does past an SOI
 * change, it decays continuously, and the widening `lower`/`upper` bracket
 * beside it is what expresses that. `TopicModel.bandAt` now exists, so the
 * obvious move is to carry that bracket here and drop the constant. It is the
 * wrong move, because the two answer different questions.
 *
 * A band says HOW WRONG the number might be. A horizon says whether the model
 * still describes the same REGIME. Those come apart precisely here, because
 * what invalidates a `rates` entry is not accumulating noise but a DISCRETE
 * event: a converter switching, a crew shift, a craft crossing into shadow. At
 * a shadow boundary the net electric-charge rate flips SIGN, and after that the
 * model is not imprecise, it is integrating in the wrong direction. A band
 * widening symmetrically around a falling line does not contain a rising one,
 * so no interval this model could offer would cover the case the horizon is
 * for.
 *
 * Twenty minutes is roughly a low orbit, which is where that constant comes
 * from. The better version of this withdraws on EVIDENCE rather than at a
 * chosen number: window `kerbalism.lifesupport` through `depWindows` and
 * decline when the observed rate has changed sign inside the window. That is a
 * strictly better model and it is not this one.
 *
 * ## And why this model offers no band at all
 *
 * `BandKind` is `"bound" | "sigma1"` and the honest interval here is neither.
 * The bracket `resourceProjection.ts` mints spans two NAMED SCENARIOS (the rate
 * held for the whole interval; the rate stopped the instant contact was lost),
 * which its own doc is explicit is "not a bound on the truth", because a
 * converter switching on can put the real level outside it. It is not a sigma
 * either: the wire carries exactly one rate sample, so there is no distribution
 * to take a standard deviation of. Stamping `"bound"` on it would promise
 * containment this wire cannot support, and a fabricated band is worse than
 * none. `kerbalism.crew`'s model DOES band, because its rate is a fit with
 * residuals; see `crewReckoning.ts`.
 *
 * ## And why it is a CEILING on reach rather than the only reason to stop
 *
 * A level also withdraws the moment the model's own arithmetic carries it out
 * of the range the quantity can occupy, and for most tanks that comes a long
 * way first: a quarter-full tank filling at a unit a second is at its capacity
 * in three hundred seconds. See {@link resourceBoundaryCrossings}.

 * The UT one level would leave the range it can occupy at, on the rate that was
 * measured.
 *
 * ## Why the model publishes this rather than clamping
 *
 * The level used to be clamped into `[0, capacity]` and the model went on
 * answering, which put a tank at ZERO on a craft whose last observation saw it
 * full, for as long as the horizon allowed. A clamp is not a withdrawal: it is
 * a confident positive claim, and at a readout it is indistinguishable from an
 * observation of an empty tank. The clamp was symmetric, so a positive net rate
 * did the same thing at the other end and reported a FULL one.
 *
 * The model stops at the crossing instead, and hands the crossed level back at
 * its last observed value. That withdrawal is honest and it is also silent,
 * which is why the moment itself is published: a consumer holding one can say
 * "empty by about UT X, modelled" where otherwise it could only show a level
 * that had quietly stopped moving.
 *
 * ## Why a UT, and why this vocabulary rather than a new one
 *
 * It is a time, and `Value<"ut">` is the spelling the reckoning vocabulary
 * already has for an absolute moment (`Reckoning.atUt` is one). A duration
 * would be the same fact measured from the frame, so it would have to be
 * recomputed every frame and would need a second anchor stated beside it to
 * mean anything at all. This one is a fact about the OBSERVATION and does not
 * move as the view time does.
 *
 * It sits on its own entry point rather than on the model's answer for exactly
 * that reason: it is not a function of `viewUt`, so a caller needs no frame to
 * ask for it, and it is still there on the frames where the model has withdrawn
 * and has no answer to hang it off.
 *
 * `boundary` names the END of the range rather than the condition, because the
 * two ends are one rule. Zero is not a special number here: a consumer renders
 * `"floor"` as empty and `"ceiling"` as full, and nothing upstream of that has
 * to know which of them a given craft is heading for.
