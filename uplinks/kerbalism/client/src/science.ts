// This Uplink's namespaces of the four elected `science.*` payloads' provider
// extension bags: the typed half, which is deliberately NOT in core.
//
// `science.*` is a Kernel-elected capability, so each channel is a single shared
// shape core declares and whichever backend won the election fills. Kerbalism WINS
// that election when installed, and most of what it knows has no stock field to land
// in: drive capacity, file-vs-sample, the reason an experiment is not running, a
// per-subject ledger, a continuous transmit rate. Core's generated `extensions` is
// opaque by construction (`ProviderExtensions` = a record of `unknown`), because a
// generated type that pretended to know a provider's shape would be the closed-enum
// mistake the open `SitrepUnit` union already refused once. So the types live HERE,
// in the package that also writes the sub-trees server-side.
//
// A consuming widget therefore imports the readers below rather than reaching into
// `entry.extensions?.kerbalism` and casting at the call site. That is the whole
// boundary: core stays open and opaque, the provider supplies the type at its own
// edge.
//
// Read this before using a shared field on a Kerbalism-sourced science frame.
//
// Kerbalism leaves several core fields NULL because its model does not fit their
// declared unit or meaning, and the entry's `valueModel` tag is what says so:
// `dataAmount`/`dataStored`/`dataStorage`/`dataMits` (mits, Kerbalism has megabytes,
// see `dataSizeMB` here), `baseTransmitValue`/`transmitBonus` (Kerbalism's
// stock-interop bridge hardcodes them; see `sciencePerMB`), `scienceRate`/
// `storedScience` on a lab (Kerbalism's lab makes files, not science; see
// `effectiveRateMBps`). Those nulls are structural, not "nothing yet".
