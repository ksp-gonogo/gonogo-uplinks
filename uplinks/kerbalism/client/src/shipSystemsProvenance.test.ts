/**
 * The live bug, closed: a Ship Systems summary knows how current the resource
 * levels it was derived from actually are.
 *
 * Every figure the summary produces (a level, a rate, a time-to-empty) is a
 * function of `vessel.resources`. The processor resolved that dep to
 * `point.payload`, the value channel alone, so it could not tell a current
 * level from one observed twenty minutes ago, and the widget presented a
 * last-contact projection as current with nothing in the render saying so.
 *
 * It now takes the READING and reports its own provenance. Not a nested
 * `Reading`: a summary reasoning across resources is not one Topic's currency.
