// KerbalismUplink client-owned Topic registration: the bare presence gate and
// the five relocated structured payload Topics.
//
// `kerbalism.available` is a bare JSON boolean the KerbalismUplink emits
// (DelayRole.TrueNow) as the Domain presence gate: it has no [SitrepTopic]
// payload POCO, so it never flows through codegen.
//
// The payload types behind `kerbalism.spaceweather` / `.profile` /
// `.lifesupport` / `.crew` / `.features` live in THIS Uplink's own contract
// slice (GonogoKerbalismUplink.Contract), not Sitrep.Contract, so the SDK
// generates nothing for them. They register here in the same two halves
// `kerbalism.available` uses, just with real generated payload types behind
// them rather than `boolean`:
//
//   • TYPE: a `declare module "@ksp-gonogo/sitrep-sdk"` augmentation adds each
//     Topic to `TopicPayloadMap`, so `useTelemetry("kerbalism.crew")` resolves to
//     `KerbalismCrewEntry[]` in any program that statically imports this module.
//   • RUNTIME: `registerBarePrimitiveTopic(...)` at module load feeds the SDK's
//     runtime registry, so `isTopicId` / `getAllKnownTopicIds` enumerate them
//     without the SDK ever naming the string.
//
// `index.ts` imports this module for its side effect (the registrations + the
// ambient augmentation), so importing the package wires every half.

// The runtime half of the relocation, and this Domain needs BOTH registries
// more than any relocated slice before it.
//
// `registerTopicUnits` covers a Topic's OWN fields. That is the whole job for a
// flat payload, and none of these five is flat:
//
//   kerbalism.spaceweather  stars: KerbalismStarInfo[], storms: KerbalismStormEntry[]
//   kerbalism.crew          rules: KerbalismCrewRule[]  (the per-kerbal dose lives HERE)
//   kerbalism.lifesupport   habitat, processes[], greenhouses[]
//   kerbalism.profile       resources{}, rules[], processes[]
//
// `wrapTopicPayload` learns from `shapesForTopic` that a field holds another
// shape, then recurses through `wrapTypePayload`, which resolves that shape BY
// TYPE NAME via `unitsForType`/`shapesForType`. Those read the SDK's TYPE-keyed
// generated maps, which no longer carry a single Kerbalism entry. So without the
// `registerTypeUnits` loop below, every per-kerbal rule dose, every per-star
// distance, every process capacity and every greenhouse flux would arrive as a
// BARE NUMBER while ../__generated__/contract.ts still types it Value<...>.
// `topics.test.ts` pins exactly that, at decode time through a real
// TelemetryClient, and asserts the two halves separately so neither can stand in
// for the other.
//
// KerbalismStarInfo.direction makes the type registry load-bearing one step
// further than the topic registry could ever reach: it is a Vec3 whose unit is
// declared on the FIELD and emitted as three dotted leaf keys
// ("direction.x"/".y"/".z"), on a type that is only ever reached through
// spaceweather's `stars` array. Two hops of shape resolution, then a fan-out to
// three leaves.
//
// Driven by looping over the generated maps rather than naming each entry, so a
// type or Topic added to this Uplink's contract later needs no new call site.

 * This is the per-Uplink half of the SDK's `_AssertNoTopicResolvesToUnknown`,
