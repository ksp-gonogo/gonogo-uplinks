// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The Kerbalism namespaces of the two elected isru.* payloads' provider extension
// bags.
//
// isru.* is a Kernel-ELECTED capability (Sitrep.Contract/Isru.cs): one shared
// payload shape per channel, filled by whichever backend won. Kerbalism WINS that
// election when installed, because it does not add to stock's ISRU model, it
// replaces it: its own MM patches delete ModuleResourceHarvester and
// ModuleResourceConverter outright, so on a Kerbalism install the stock reader
// walks a vessel and finds nothing at all.
//
// Unlike science, most of what Kerbalism's ISRU knows DOES have a stock
// counterpart, which is why the core shape carries it and these two types are
// small. What is left over is genuinely Kerbalism-only:
//
//   • the blocking-reason string. Stock has no equivalent: a stock drill that
//     cannot extract just silently switches itself off. This is the single
//     strongest thing the Kerbalism provider adds, because "why is Ore production
//     zero" otherwise has no answer on the wire at all
//   • the asteroid/comet depletion state, where abundance is a property of the
//     rock rather than of the environment
//   • the ProcessController's own throttle state, which has no stock analogue
//     because a stock converter IS its recipe rather than a capacity that
//     throttles a decoupled one
//
// TYPING-ONLY, exactly like KerbalismPayloads.cs and KerbalismScienceExt.cs: this
// adds no wire bytes. The wire is written by JsonWriter walking the untyped value
// tree KerbalismIsruBackend builds, and the two are kept honest by
// IsruExtensionWireTests (the real backend through the real EnvelopeCodec) plus
// the golden fixture the client's own test reads back.
//
// ── No unit token is declared here, deliberately ────────────────────────────
// Every quantity below is dimensioned in a unit Sitrep.Contract.Units already has
// (units/s, t, count). That is not an accident of scope: Kerbalism measures ISRU
// in the same resource units the game does, unlike its science, which is in
// megabytes where stock is in mits. So this bag needs no registerUnit call at all,
// and the client half is purely the shape registration.
