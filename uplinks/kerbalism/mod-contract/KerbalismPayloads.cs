// Kerbalism Topic payloads (Domain "kerbalism").
//
// The GonogoKerbalismUplink (mod/GonogoKerbalismUplink/) publishes these by
// reflecting over Kerbalism's KERBALISM.API / Features / DB.Kerbal(name).rules
// and the ProcessController PartModules, the SAME reflection the proven
// mod/GonogoDevTools/GonogoDevKerbalismDump.cs performs (it produced the
// fixtures these shapes are grounded in: local_docs/kerbalism-fixtures/,
// canonical kerbalism-fixture-baseline-crp.json).
//
// TYPING-ONLY: these mirror, field-for-field, the
// Dictionary<string, object?> value trees KerbalismCapture.Build* emit (camelCase
// wire keys via RtConfig.CamelCaseForProperties). They add no wire bytes; the
// wire is written by JsonWriter walking the uplink's live value tree. All members
// are nullable to mirror the permissive-on-absence convention; a live payload
// always carries concrete values.
//
// These types are declared in this Uplink's own contract slice, never in
// mod/Sitrep.Contract: no uplink-specific wire type may live in core. See this
// project's .csproj header for the rule.
//
// kerbalism.available is a BARE JSON boolean declared client-side
// (mod/GonogoKerbalismUplink/client/src/topics.ts via registerBarePrimitiveTopic),
// NOT here, same treatment as the other Uplinks' bare `<domain>.available`.
