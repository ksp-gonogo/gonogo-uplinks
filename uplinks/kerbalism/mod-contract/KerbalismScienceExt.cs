namespace GonogoKerbalismUplink;

// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The Kerbalism namespaces of the four elected science.* payloads' provider
// extension bags.
//
// science.* is a Kernel-ELECTED capability (Sitrep.Contract/ScienceCapability.cs):
// one shared payload shape per channel, filled by whichever backend won. Kerbalism
// WINS that election when installed, because it does not merely add to stock's
// science model, it replaces it: data accrues over time at a rate, lives on drives
// as files or samples with real capacity limits, is gated by a 62-condition
// requirement system, and is transmitted continuously highest-value-first rather
// than sent by a click.
//
// Almost none of that has a stock counterpart to borrow a field from. These four
// types are where it goes: Kerbalism's own sub-trees, declared and typed HERE,
// carried under the provider id "kerbalism". The alternative was ~15 nullable
// members on core payloads that exactly one mod would ever fill, which is the
// hand-curated-superset anti-pattern the bag replaces (see
// Sitrep.Contract/ProviderExtensions.cs, and the ratchet
// Sitrep.Host.Tests.ScienceProviderExtensionRatchetTests).
//
// TYPING-ONLY, exactly like KerbalismPayloads.cs: this adds no wire bytes. The wire
// is written by JsonWriter walking the untyped value tree KerbalismScienceMap
// builds, and the two are kept honest by ScienceExtensionWireTests (the real map
// through the real EnvelopeCodec) plus the golden fixture the client's own test
// reads back.
//
// ── UNITS: MB, MB/s, science/MB are this Uplink's OWN tokens ────────────────
// None of the three is in Sitrep.Contract.Units, and none needs to be:
// SitrepUnitAttribute has always taken an arbitrary string and UnitDescriptor.Collect
// carries an Uplink-declared token into the published vocabulary (Sitrep.Core.Tests
// .UnitDescriptorTests pins that with a deliberate "banana"). That openness is the
// same reason the generated SitrepUnit union is open: an Uplink cannot add a member
// to a const-string class in core, so closing it would mean a third party could
// never declare a unit at all.
//
// ── Why megabytes never land in a mits-typed core field ─────────────────────
// A core field's unit is compile-time baked and cannot vary by elected provider
// (unitsForTopic returns the GENERATED entry first, so a provider registering units
// against a core Topic is ignored by construction). Kerbalism's data figures are
// megabytes. So the Kerbalism backend leaves core's mits-typed DataAmount/DataStored
// /DataMits NULL and puts the real figures here, tagged MB. Absence plus a correct
// number beats a right number under a wrong label: "2.4 Mit" over a megabyte figure
// is the silent mits/MB conflation Kerbalism's own stock-interop bridge already
// makes, and inheriting it was the one thing the superset survey said not to do.
