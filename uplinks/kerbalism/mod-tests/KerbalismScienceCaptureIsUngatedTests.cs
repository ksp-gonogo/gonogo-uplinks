     * A SOURCE assertion, and it says so rather than pretending otherwise.

     * The thing worth guarding is behavioural: the science capture must run on
     * every tick, because its Courier handler stashes the bundle that the five
     * File Manager verbs read as their pre-filter, and a skipped capture leaves
     * those verbs refusing with ModeUnavailable about an install that models
     * science. A behavioural case cannot reach it. `KerbalismUplink.Register`
     * reads `FlightGlobals` and this Tests project compiles a curated file list
     * that deliberately excludes the KSP-touching half, so nothing here can
     * drive the registration.
     *
     * So this reads the registration instead. It is weaker than driving it, and
     * the failure it CAN express is the one that actually happened: somebody
     * adding a topic prefix back to that call for the per-tick cost, without
     * noticing the handler's effect escapes the publish path.
