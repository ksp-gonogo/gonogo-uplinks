/// named its consumables as four fixed properties, food/water/oxygen/
/// electricCharge, against a default profile that runs on twelve, and the four
/// were spelled out three times over: as properties on
/// <c>KerbalismLifeSupport</c>, as literal lookups in
/// <c>KerbalismUplink.CaptureOnMain</c>, and as fields on the widget's own
/// consumable type. Nothing about that set was wrong; what was wrong was that it
/// had never been written down as a choice, so a Kerbalism player wondering where
/// their CO2 reading went had to read three files to find out. This file wrote it
/// down, and listed the eight that were missing, so the omission was on the
/// record. It also carried instructions for carrying one more name by editing
/// four files.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why those instructions are gone.</b> There is nothing to carry any
/// more. <c>rates</c> is a map keyed by resource name, and the names come from
/// <see cref="KerbalismCapture.ResourceNames"/> walking the loaded profile's own
/// rules, processes and supplies. Install ROKerbalism, or any profile, and the
/// ledger follows it without a line of gonogo changing. The static definitions
/// travel alongside on <c>kerbalism.profile</c>.</para>
///
/// <para><b>What is NOT lost, and never was.</b> Amounts and capacities reach the
/// app for every resource regardless: <c>vessel.resources</c> is a name-keyed map
/// and <c>KspHost.BuildPartResources</c> iterates every <c>PartResource</c> on
/// every part, so a tank of Nitrogen shows up there like any other. What was lost
/// was the RATE, because <c>ResourceAverageRate</c> is Kerbalism's own API, is
/// the one number the generic path cannot derive, and was called for exactly four
/// names. That is the gap this closed.</para>
///
/// <para><b>What this file is now.</b> A regression guard. The tests below fail
/// if a resource name reappears anywhere it can be hardcoded, or if the one
/// enumeration that drives both the profile payload and the rate lookups ever
/// splits into two.</para>
