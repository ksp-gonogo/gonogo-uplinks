# Encoded-transform delay spike

Throwaway harness for the question of whether a delayed video frame can be held
in an encoded transform rather than in the player. Not part of the production
build, and it lives inside the client only so its Playwright driver scripts can
resolve the package's `node_modules/playwright` via normal Node ESM resolution;
nothing here is imported by kerbcast's own source or tests.

## What's here

- `harness-a.html` + `worker-a.js`: encoded-transform delay test. Loopback
  WebRTC (two in-page `RTCPeerConnection`s, canvas-captured source),
  `RTCRtpScriptTransform` on the receiver holds every encoded video frame
  for a fixed delay (default 4000ms) before writing it back into the
  pipeline. The source canvas encodes its own elapsed-ms timestamp as a
  32-bit black/white block barcode; the receiver reads it back off the
  rendered `<video>` via `requestVideoFrameCallback` + pixel sampling, so
  the measured delay is ground-truth (not inferred from WebRTC's own
  internal counters).
- `harness-b.html`: decoded-`VideoFrame` pool-exhaustion test, sourced
  directly from a `canvas.captureStream()` track (no WebRTC).
- `harness-c.html`: same pool-exhaustion test, but sourced from a real
  WebRTC **remote** track after decode (loopback `RTCPeerConnection`),
  which is architecturally what the current production Chrome backend
  does. Both B and C hold ~150-210 `VideoFrame`s without ever `close()`ing
  them and time every `reader.read()` to look for stalls.
- `server.mjs`: tiny static file server (no deps) so the harnesses run
  over `http://localhost` instead of `file://` (Worker/CORS behaviour is
  inconsistent under `file://` across engines, especially Firefox).
- `run-a.mjs` / `run-b.mjs` / `run-c.mjs`, Playwright drivers. Each
  launches chromium/firefox/webkit (or a single named engine as `argv[2]`),
  navigates to the harness, waits for `window.__harness*Result.done`, and
  prints the JSON result plus a one-line summary.

## Running

```
cd mod/GonogoKerbcastUplink/client/spike-encoded-transform-delay
node run-a.mjs            # all three engines
node run-a.mjs firefox    # one engine
node run-b.mjs chromium
node run-c.mjs chromium
```

Requires `nvm use` first (Node 24) and a `pnpm install` at the repo root so
`mod/GonogoKerbcastUplink/client/node_modules/playwright` exists with its cached browser
binaries.
