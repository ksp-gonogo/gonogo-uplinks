// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Delayed-playout STATUS side channel (cross-browser kerbcast video-delay
// design, 2026-07-16). `useDelayedKerbcastStream` is called BY the kerbcam
// SDK's `useStream` seam, which constrains its return type to
// `MediaStream | null` (`CameraStreamHook`: see `kerbcast-react`'s
// `CameraFeed.d.ts`). That leaves no channel for `CameraFeed.tsx` (which
// does NOT call this hook itself, the SDK does, internally) to learn
// "delay was expected here but the pipeline couldn't be built", which it
// needs to render the explicit "delayed feed unavailable" state (decision
// 5: never the live stream).
//
// Fix: this hook writes its OWN `DelayedPlayoutResult` into a tiny external
// store keyed by `flightId`, and `useDelayedPlaybackStatus` (below) reads it
// via `useSyncExternalStore`: the same "refcounted external resource,
// subscribe/notify" shape `KerbcastDataSource` and `PerfBudget` already use
// elsewhere in this codebase, just sized for a single in-memory value
// instead of a class. `CameraFeed.tsx` calls `useDelayedPlaybackStatus`
// directly (its own hook call, independent of the SDK's `useStream`
// invocation): no second pipeline is built; this is read-only.
//
// Status keying: by `flightId`, so two consumers of the SAME camera (e.g. a
// CameraFeed and the docking-HUD backdrop) share one status entry. That is
// now CORRECT rather than a lossy compromise: as of the per-camera sharing in
// `useDelayedPlayout` (2026-07-17) those two consumers ARE one delayed
// pipeline: `sharedDelayedStreams` keys the pipeline by the raw `MediaStream`
// identity, so one `MediaStreamTrackProcessor` / `RTCRtpScriptTransform` per
// track feeds every consumer, and they necessarily see the same delayed
// output and thus the same status. Delay is a property of the camera, not the
// viewer.

/**
 * gonogo's stream source for the shared `CameraFeed`, injected via its
 * `useStream` seam. It composes three already-tested
 * pieces without moving any of them into the SDK:
 *
 *   1. the SDK/data-source glue `useKerbcastStream`: the raw live `MediaStream`
 *      for the RESOLVED flightId (auto-latch / fallback already applied by the
 *      feed, so this hook never re-derives it);
 *   2. gonogo's `DelayedPlayoutBuffer` (via `useDelayedPlayout`);
 *   3. the ONE shared `ViewClock` telemetry reads (`useViewClockOptional`),
 *      plus the kerbcast mission-time capture clock (`useKerbcastClock`, SDK
 *      1.4.0) that tells us WHEN each frame was captured.
 *
 * Single-authority guarantee: `view` is the same `ViewClock` instance every
 * delay-consistent telemetry surface reads, and the buffer only releases a
 * frame once that clock's `confirmedEdgeUt()` sweeps past the frame's capture
 * UT: so a media frame and a telemetry sample stamped the same UT surface on
 * the same clock crossing.
 *
 * Passthrough (byte-for-byte live, unchanged) in two cases, both by feeding
 * `useDelayedPlayout` no delay config:
 *   - no `TelemetryProvider` in the tree (`view === undefined`), the LAN case;
 *   - no capture clock yet (`captureUt == null`, old kerbcast plugin/sidecar,
 *     or before the first ~1Hz sample), so we never hold video without knowing
 *     when it was captured.
 *
 * When both are present, each arriving frame is stamped with the live capture
 * UT (the ~1Hz sample interpolated forward by warp rate) and released against
 * `confirmedEdgeUt()`. A `resetEpoch` bump (revert / quickload / scene reload)
 * flushes the buffer so it resyncs rather than waiting on a UT that will never
 * arrive.
 *
 * Adapts `useDelayedPlayout`'s discriminated `DelayedPlayoutResult` down to
 * the `MediaStream | null` the SDK's `useStream` seam requires, `"raw"` and
 * `"delayed"` surface their stream (possibly `null` for `"raw"` while the
 * camera connects); `"connecting"` and `"unavailable"` both surface `null`
 * (the SDK just shows its own connecting/no-signal look either way). The
 * full result (including `"unavailable"`'s reason) is separately
 * published for `CameraFeed.tsx` to read via `useDelayedPlaybackStatus`
 * (see this module's top-of-file doc), so "can't delay" gets its own
 * explicit UI rather than being indistinguishable from "still connecting".
 *
 * MUST be a stable module-scope reference (never redefined per render) and
 * passed consistently to `CameraFeed`, per the `useStream` rules-of-hooks
 * contract.
