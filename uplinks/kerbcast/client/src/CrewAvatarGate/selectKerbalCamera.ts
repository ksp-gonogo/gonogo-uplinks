/**
 * Find the live kerbal face camera for a crew member, by NAME.
 *
 * kerbcast keys a `kind: Kerbal` camera on `cameraName`, which is the kerbal's
 * stable identity: `kerbalPersistentId` looked stable
 * but actually changes seat<->EVA (KSP mints a fresh `persistentID` on EVA),
 * so it is the WRONG key. `cameraName` (the kerbal's full name, e.g.
 * "Jebediah Kerman") stays constant across seat/EVA transitions and is
 * unique in the roster: and it is also the only identity CrewStatus's
 * `vessel.crew` roster carries (no kerbal id crosses the Sitrep contract),
 * so it is the sole correlation key available on either side.
 *
 * Returns `null` when no kerbal camera exists for this name (mod not
 * installed, kerbal not seated/on EVA, or facecams not yet connected); the
 * caller renders nothing for that row's avatar cell in that case.
