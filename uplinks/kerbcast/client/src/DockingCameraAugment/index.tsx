// kerbcast docking-camera augment for Targeting.
//
// Fills Targeting's `targeting.camera` slot with a live video backdrop behind
// the docking reticle. This is the filler that widget's augment-slot doc block
// was written for, and the only one: Targeting ships no built-in backdrop, so
// without this augment the HUD composes with no video layer at all.
//
// Why an augment and not a standalone CameraFeed instance: the backdrop has to
// draw in the HUD's own reticle space and share its lifecycle. The slot passes
// `TargetingHudContext` for exactly that, and `requires: "kerbcast"`
// means an install without the kerbcast mod composes the HUD without any video
// layer at all: rather than the core client shipping a camera path it can
// never light up.
//
// Presence-gated on `kerbcast.available`; camera CHOICE comes off the Uplink's
// `kerbcast.cameras` control channel (`isDockingCamera`), while the MEDIA still
// rides kerbcast's own WebRTC path (`useDelayedKerbcastStream`, which delays it
// on the shared ViewClock). That split is the whole design: control plane on
// the Uplink, media off it.
