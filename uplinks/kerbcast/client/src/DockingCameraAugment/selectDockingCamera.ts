import type { KerbcastCameraEntry } from "../__generated__/contract";

/**
 * Picks the camera that should back Targeting's docking HUD, from the
 * `kerbcast.cameras` inventory the Uplink publishes.
 *
 * `isDockingCamera` is `bool?` on the wire (`DockingCameraFacts.cs`), and the
 * three states are genuinely distinct, the mod's own doc is explicit that
 * `false` means "read the part, it has no docking module", while absent means
 * "couldn't read the part at all". Collapsing null to false would demote a
 * camera we simply failed to introspect to the same rank as one we positively
 * know isn't a docking camera. So cameras rank:
 *
 *   1. `true`     : known docking camera, the whole point of the augment
 *   2. `null`/absent: unknown; might be one, ranks above a known-negative
 *   3. `false`    : known not a docking camera; last resort, never excluded
 *
 * Rank 3 is still eligible on purpose: showing SOME feed beats showing none,
 * so a known-negative camera is used rather than nothing. `isDockingCamera`
 * sharpens the CHOICE; it never narrows the pool.
 *
 * An explicit `override` (the widget's saved `cameraFlightId`) always wins when
 * that camera is still present, so a pinned camera keeps working. A stale
 * override (pinned camera no longer in the inventory) falls through to the
 * ranking rather than blanking the HUD.
 *
 * Returns the kerbcast `flightId` to stream, or `null` when there is nothing to
 * show. `cameraId` IS the kerbcast flightId: `KerbcastCameraEntryBuilder.Build`
 * maps `["cameraId"] = view.FlightId`. That identity is what lets this augment
 * select on Uplink CONTROL facts and stream over kerbcast's own WebRTC media
 * path without a second identifier space.
