/**
 * Backend 0: encoded transform on the receiver. Proves the wiring is real: when
 * `KerbcastDataSource.getReceiverForStream` resolves a receiver and
 * `RTCRtpScriptTransform` exists, this backend is tried FIRST and, on
 * success, surfaces `raw` itself (unchanged) as the delayed stream, no new
 * track, the delay happens in place upstream of decode.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY A SEPARATE FILE from `useKerbcastStream.delay.test.tsx`:
 * `kerbcastDelayWorkerClient.ts` caches its shared `Worker` in module-level
 * state (`getSharedWorker()`, `sharedWorker !== undefined` short-circuit):
 * once any test in a given module graph resolves it to `null` (because
 * `Worker` was undefined in jsdom at that moment), every later test in the
 * SAME file inherits that cached `null`, even after stubbing `Worker`.
 * Vitest gives each test FILE its own fresh module graph by default, so a
 * separate file is the correct isolation boundary here, not reordering
 * (fragile to future edits) and not `vi.resetModules()` (this module has no
 * exported reset hook, and reaching into its internals would be more
 * fragile than just not sharing the file).
