 *     backend that can reach Firefox at all. Delays IN PLACE (no new track):
 *     on success the result's `stream` is `raw` itself, unchanged, the delay
 *     happens transparently upstream of decode.
 *  1. **Main-thread Breakout Box** (`isFrameDelaySupported()` /
 *     `createFrameDelayStream`): Chrome, tried when (0) can't attach (no
 *     receiver resolvable: e.g. a test fixture, or a future non-`BrowserRTCTransport`
 *     transport: or the browser lacks `RTCRtpScriptTransform`).
 *  2. **Worker-hosted Breakout Box** (`createWorkerFrameDelayStream`):
 *     tried only when (0) and (1) are both unavailable. Safari and WebKit
 *     support this, which is what puts it behind (1) rather than ahead.
 *
 * If NO backend can build a pipeline, resolves `{kind: "unavailable",
 * reason}`: **never** the raw stream. Falling back to `raw` would hand the
 * operator UNDELAYED video while the telemetry beside it is delayed, and a
 * one-time console warning is not something they will see. "Can't delay" is a
