    /// <para><b>Why this lives here and not in kerbcast.</b> kerbcast has no
    /// docking concept anywhere on its wire: not in <c>CameraInfo</c>, not in
    /// <c>CameraState</c>, not in its data-channel protocol. Its only nod to
    /// docking is a Hullcam *visual filter mode* called "DockingCam", which is
    /// a reticle overlay, not a fact about the craft. So today the ONLY way a
    /// client can guess is to sniff <c>partTitle</c> for the word "Docking" or
    /// match <c>cameraName == "NavCam"</c>, which is exactly what kerbcast's
    /// own client-side labeller resorts to.</para>
    ///
    /// <para>That sniffing is wrong in both directions: it false-POSITIVES on
    /// any part someone named "Docking Bay Floodlight", and it false-NEGATIVES
    /// on every modded docking port that doesn't happen to have "Docking" in
    /// its title. It also can't tell a mated port from a free one.</para>
    ///
    /// <para><b>The Uplink can do better for free.</b> kerbcast's control facade
    /// already hands out the owning stock KSP <c>Part</c> on every camera view.
    /// A <c>Part</c> is stock KSP, gonogo references <c>Assembly-CSharp</c>
    /// freely, no licence entanglement: so this uplink simply reads the part's
    /// own <c>ModuleDockingNode</c> and answers from the craft's actual module
    /// list. Ground truth, not a string guess, and it needs ZERO changes to
    /// kerbcast.</para>

    /// <para><b>The definition, stated precisely:</b> a docking camera is a
    /// camera whose OWN part carries a <c>ModuleDockingNode</c>. A camera
    /// merely mounted *near* a port is NOT reported as a docking camera,
    /// proximity would be a heuristic with a made-up radius, and this contract
    /// does not fabricate confidence it doesn't have. In practice the stock
    /// docking-port cameras (Hullcam's docking-port patch) all satisfy the
    /// strict definition, because the camera module is added to the port part
    /// itself.</para>
