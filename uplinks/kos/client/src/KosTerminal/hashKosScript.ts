/**
 * djb2 hash of a kerboscript body, base-36. Fast, deterministic,
 * collision-resistant enough for "did the script change since last
 * write" detection. NOT cryptographic: pulling in a real hasher
 * would add bundle weight for zero benefit, since the only consumer
 * is the wrapper's `<path>.ver` sidecar comparison.
 *
 * Returned as an unprefixed positive base-36 string so it's safe to
 * embed in a kOS string literal without needing to escape anything.
 *
 * Resurrected from the deleted KosFiles widget (`git show
 * 855bd024^:mod/GonogoKosUplink/client/src/shared/hashKosScript.ts`) for the
 * `/`-script picker's live drive listing: same managed-script
 * check-and-write contract, unrelated to any other consumer.
