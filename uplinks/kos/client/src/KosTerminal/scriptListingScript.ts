/**
 * Kerboscript for the `/`-script picker's live drive listing.
 * Resurrected VERBATIM from the deleted KosFiles widget (`git show
 * 855bd024^:mod/GonogoKosUplink/client/src/KosFiles/filesScript.ts`): same
 * [KOSDATA] contract, same two-mode dispatcher. The picker only ever
 * dispatches the "list" op; "read" is kept intact rather than trimmed, to
 * stay a faithful resurrection instead of a re-derived rewrite of a script
 * that was already proven correct.
 *
 *   RUN files("list", "0:")             → emits a JSON listing of that
 *                                          volume's top-level files.
 *   RUN files("list", "0:/scripts")     → emits a JSON listing of a
 *                                          subdirectory.
 *   RUN files("read", "0:/path.ks")     → emits the file's text content.
 *
 * Output contract:
 *   [KOSDATA]op=list;path=<absolute>;listing=<json-array>[/KOSDATA]
 *   [KOSDATA]op=read;path=<absolute>;contents="<json-escaped string>"[/KOSDATA]
 *
 * Each listing entry: `{ name, size, isDir }`. `isDir` lets a caller
 * recurse into subdirectories (the picker itself doesn't; see
 * `useKosScriptListing`'s doc comment). `size` and `isDir` are both JSON
 * null when the volume could not report them, never a substituted 0 or
 * false: see `KosFileEntry`.
 *
 * Escaping notes: `;` is the [KOSDATA] field delimiter, so file contents
 * containing `;` would otherwise truncate. We escape `;` as `;` along
 * with the usual JSON specials (`\\`, `\"`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`). The caller's
 * `JSON.parse` decodes everything back transparently.
 *
 * kOS strings don't have C-style backslash escapes (a literal `\` is just
 * a backslash), so we build escape characters via `CHAR()` + concat.
 *
 * `pathArg` (not `target`) is the parameter name because `TARGET` is a
 * kOS global / suffix and shadowing it has a history of confusing the
 * parser depending on context.
