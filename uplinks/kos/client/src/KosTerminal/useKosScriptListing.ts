 * telemetry nor a fixed no-args interval script.
 *
 * Lazy + single-shot: does nothing until `enabled` is true (the terminal
 * only passes `true` once the `/`-picker is actually open AND no static
 * `scriptPaths` config already supplies a list), and fetches at most once
 * per `(coreId, cpuTag)` pair, reopening the picker within the same
 * session reuses the cached result rather than re-dispatching. Degrades
 * gracefully (empty `paths` + a `hint`, never a thrown error) on a
 * tagless CPU, no telemetry stream mounted, or a dispatch/timeout error,
 * `executeScript` itself is the thing flagged unverified-in-source for
 * this environment (`KosExtension.Ksp.cs:335-340`), so every failure mode
