// The "resolves to a core gonogo Value type" half of the uplink-types-out-of-core

// generated contract must still resolve to the core unit-system module
// (@ksp-gonogo/sitrep-sdk), never a locally hand-rolled Value type. See
// KosRtConfig.Configure's `valueImportFrom` argument, which is the mechanism
// this test verifies actually took effect in the emitted file, not just in the
// C# call site.
//
// NOT vacuous, but only just, and the honest accounting is the point of this
// file rather than a caveat to it: EXACTLY ONE property in the whole nine-type
// slice retypes, KosComputeStatus.lastGoodAt -> Value<"ut">. Every other declared
// unit here is a non-quantity token (id / text / flag / count) or sits on an
// inbound-only "...Args" type that ApplyUnitValueTypes deliberately skips, so
// one property is the entire retyped surface. A regression that dropped the
// retyping would leave this file's first assertion with nothing to find, which
// is why the second one pins the property by name.
