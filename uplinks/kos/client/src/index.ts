// kOS Uplink client for gonogo.
//
// Co-located with the GonogoKosUplink C# mod (mod/GonogoKosUplink): one directory holds
// the mod and the client TS it ships. Importing this
// package's entry point side-effects the widget registration into
// @ksp-gonogo/core's global registry:
//
//   - KosTerminal → registerComponent(...) so it's placeable from the
//     dashboard widget picker. It reads kos.processors and the terminal
//     frame stream directly.
//
// To wire it into the app: `import "@ksp-gonogo/gonogo-kos-uplink";` during app bootstrap
// (alongside the other component-registration imports in app/src/main.tsx).
//
// Everything kOS-specific lives in this package: the CPU registry, the
// [KOSDATA] parser, and the KosDataSource transport itself (`dataSource/
// kos.ts`: `kos.run` dispatch, `kos.processors` CPU discovery, the
// kerboscript wrapper builder). This is NOT a thin UI-only client over an
// app-side transport.

// defineUplinkClient(KOS): every widget/augment this package registers
// stamps the returned handle as `owner`, so the widget picker's mod search
// tags derive "kos" automatically.
// (Also re-run by `./runtime`, below, idempotent, see that module's doc.)
