// Non-widget kOS runtime infra: split out of `index.ts` so importing it does
// NOT evaluate `./KosTerminal`.
//
// MainScreen/StationScreen need `CpuRegistryProvider`/`CpuRegistryService`/
// `KosCpuDiscovery` regardless of whether the KosTerminal WIDGET itself is
// statically bundled or loaded at runtime via the Uplink loader
// (`app/src/uplinks/loader.ts`). Before this split they imported those names
// from the package root (`@ksp-gonogo/gonogo-kos-uplink`), which forced evaluation of the
// WHOLE `index.ts` module: ES module evaluation always runs a module's full
// top-level code once, regardless of which named export the importer actually
// uses, including `export * from "./KosTerminal"`, which self-registers the
// "kos-terminal" widget via `registerComponent`. `@ksp-gonogo/core` makes that
// call THROW on a duplicate id (by design, component ids must be unique), so
// under the runtime-loader flag the loader's OWN dynamically-imported
// `kos.client.js` bundle always collided with the copy MainScreen had already
// registered at module-load time, and always quarantined
// ("Component id \"kos-terminal\" is already registered...", caught by
// `uplink-loader.spec.ts`'s Settings "Loaded clients" panel assertion).
//
// Every registration this file DOES still trigger (`defineUplinkClient`,
// `registerUplinkHandle`) is Map-based and idempotent, re-running it from
// both this file AND the loaded bundle is harmless, unlike `registerComponent`.
//
// `index.ts` re-exports this file, so nothing downstream of the package root
// loses access to these names: only MainScreen/StationScreen need to import
// from `@ksp-gonogo/gonogo-kos-uplink/runtime` specifically instead of the package root.

import "./uplink"; // defineUplinkClient(KOS): idempotent re-registration
import "./dataSource/kos"; // registerUplinkHandle("kos", kosSource): idempotent
// registerBarePrimitiveTopic("kos.processors") + the two unit-registry loops,
// all idempotent (a Set, and last-write-wins Maps), so re-running them from both
// this file AND `index.ts`'s re-export is harmless in the same way the two above
// are. It has to be HERE and not only in `index.ts`, because this is the module
// MainScreen/StationScreen import: `kos.processors` used to be a static member of
// the SDK's own TOPIC_IDS and is now a runtime registration, so without this any
// consumer that loads only the runtime half would see `isTopicId
// ("kos.processors")` go false and `getAllKnownTopicIds()` drop it, which would
// quietly cost the replay recorder a channel.
