// fails as `getHost().<member> is not a function` the first time a widget is
// re-pointed at the facade.
//
// The four augment members come from `@ksp-gonogo/ui-kit` because that is where
// the augment registry and `<AugmentSlot>` live, and ui-kit imports the sdk, so
// the sdk cannot import them back. Everything else in the host is the sdk's own
