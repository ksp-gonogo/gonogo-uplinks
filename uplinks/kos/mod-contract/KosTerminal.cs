/// <para>The mod reads the CPU's live <c>kOS.Safe.Screen.ScreenSnapShot</c>,
/// diffs it against the last sent frame, and runs the diff through kOS's own
/// <c>kOS.UserIO.TerminalXtermMapper</c>: so <see cref="Chunk"/> is already
/// xterm-ready output bytes (VT100/xterm escape sequences), the same bytes
/// kOS's telnet server would have sent. The client writes <see cref="Chunk"/>
/// straight into xterm; there is no proxy and no telnet in the path.</para>
///
/// <para><see cref="FullRepaint"/> marks a self-contained repaint frame (the
/// client clears its terminal before applying <see cref="Chunk"/>). The mod
/// emits one on session open, on a new subscriber, and after a CPU
/// reboot/unload/CPU-switch, so a late-joining or reconnecting viewer always
/// resyncs from a clean full screen rather than an orphaned diff. Ordinary
/// incremental frames carry <c>FullRepaint = false</c>.</para>
///
/// <para>The channel's <c>ChannelDeclaration.IsKeyframe</c> predicate
/// (<c>KosExtension.Ksp.cs</c>) is wired to <see cref="FullRepaint"/>: the
/// engine's sticky-keyframe cache (<c>Sitrep.Core.Courier</c>) always
/// replays the last already-REVEALED FullRepaint frame synchronously to a
/// new subscriber, rather than whatever the channel's plain "latest archived
/// sample" happens to be (which, mid-session, is usually an ordinary
/// incremental diff with no baseline of its own to apply it to). This is
/// what lets a late/returning viewer see something immediately instead of
/// waiting out a fresh reveal-delay window for its own forced reseed to
/// mature: see local_docs/kos-terminal-feedback-2026-07-15.md's "Loading /
/// connection" section for the full root-cause writeup. A genuinely
/// first-ever subscribe to a CPU's terminal (nothing has EVER been recorded
/// for it) still has to wait out that first reseed's own delay window,
/// there is no way around that; there is nothing earlier to be sticky
/// about.</para>
