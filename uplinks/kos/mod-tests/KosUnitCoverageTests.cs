    /// own contract types to declare its unit. The sweep itself is
    /// <c>UnitCoverageAssertion.AssertExhaustive</c>, shared with every other
    /// relocated Uplink; this file names what is this Uplink's own.

    /// <para><b>Why no baseline file.</b> Every scalar property on all nine

    /// slice.</para>

    /// quantities.</b> Five of the nine are inbound-only command args, and the
    /// nine types between them declare exactly ONE property whose token names a
    /// real dimension (<see cref="KosComputeStatus.LastGoodAt"/>,
    /// <c>Units.Seconds</c>). Everything else is <c>Id</c>/<c>Text</c>/
    /// <c>Flag</c>/<c>Count</c>. That makes this the thinnest slice of the six on

    /// the retyping: a bare <c>string LeaseToken</c> added to one of the terminal
    /// arg types would be invisible to any Value-based check and is caught here.
    /// The <c>Units.Count</c> pair on <see cref="KosTerminalResizeArgs"/> is the
    /// case that shows the two halves are separate: <c>Count</c> is deliberately
    /// NOT in <c>RtConfig.NonQuantityUnits</c>, so those two would retype on any
