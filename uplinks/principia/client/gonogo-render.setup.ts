// The plan composer's drafts live in a module-scoped store, not in React state,
// which is what lets a half-composed plan survive the widget being scrolled out
// of the dashboard. One page renders every scene in turn, so without this the
// drafts one scene presses into existence are still there for the next one: the
// upload-armed scene came out showing three saved plans, two of them left behind
// by the scenes before it, and every one of those pictures is of a composer
// nobody composed.
