 * can be skipped.</p>
 *
 * <p>The line between current and stale is the orbit's OWN sidereal period, and

 * so an age shorter than one period is inside the smearing the elements already
 * carry and cannot be told from zero by the elements themselves. Past it, the
 * reading describes an orbit the craft may have left. A fixed number of seconds
 * would have said "stale" for a Munar orbit and "fresh" for a low one at the

 *
 * <p>Unknown is still a case and still says so outright: absent is not zero, and
 * an undateable reading must not read as a current one.</p>
 *
 * <p>The verdict is also an attribute, because it is otherwise carried only by a
 * colour. A tone is a CSS variable and nothing can assert on one, so the rule
 * that decides it would be the only rule here nothing could see go wrong.</p>
 *
 * <p>Text rather than a badge, and that is the size talking: a badge does not
