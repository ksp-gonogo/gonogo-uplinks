 * editor changes the plan the vessel is ALREADY flying, one burn at a time, and
 * each change is its own message. This builds a plan that does not exist yet and
 * sends it as ONE: five separate burn commands are five light-times, each able
 * to arrive late, out of order or not at all, and a vessel that received three of
 * them would fly a trajectory nobody composed and nobody approved.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing here touches the vessel until Upload.</b> Drafts are
 * command-centre objects, so two operators can work on different plans for the
 * same vessel without disturbing each other or the player at the keyboard.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The instant the draft was built from is stamped when it is built.</b> It
 * records how old the information was that the operator decided on, which is a
 * property of the moment they decided rather than of the moment they pressed
 * send. Under signal delay those are different instants, and the difference
 * between them is the whole of what makes the divergence measurable at the far
