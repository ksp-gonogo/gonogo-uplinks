 * The plan's own integration bounds, beside the sentence that says whether the

 * <p><b>Why here and not in the settings panel.</b> These are per-PLAN, not
 * per-session: they travel with the plan slot and they are the remedy for the
 * failure shown two lines above them. The prediction's tolerance and step count
 * look identical, are global, and live in settings; a console that put the four
 * together would explain a plan failure with a prediction setting.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why the two remedies are one block.</b> A plan that stops short of
 * where it was asked to end has exactly two answers: a bigger step budget, or a
 * nearer end. Running out of steps is the commoner of the two, and moving the
 * end is the cheaper write, recomputing only the final coast. Put either
 * anywhere but next to the shortfall and an operator reads "could not be drawn"
 * and goes looking in a menu; put them in different panels and they will find
 * one of the two.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>What shortening the plan costs, and why it is said here.</b> Moving the
 * end earlier makes every burn beyond it vanish, and a burn that disappeared
 * reads exactly like a burn that was deleted. The count is on screen before the
 * press, from the burn list this block already holds.</p>
 *
 * <p>Both controls freeze on the whole of the mod's plan-write gate, not on the
 * arm alone: every plan write is persisted into the player's save and
 * re-integrates on the game's own thread, so it takes an arm first, and a write
 * made while Principia is optimising is reverted without being reported.
 * Offering either anyway would spend a delay round trip to be told what the
 * reading already carries, and `frozenBecause` says which it is on screen.</p>
