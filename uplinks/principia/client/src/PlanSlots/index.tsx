/**
 * The plan slot itself: whether this craft has a flight plan, which of its ten
 * it is, and the four writes that change that answer.
 *
 * <p><b>Why one section rather than four controls.</b> Create, install, copy and
 * delete are not four independent verbs, they are the transitions of one state
 * machine over two fields of the reading. `planExists` decides whether create or
 * delete is the legal one and the plugin REFUSES the other by name
 * (`PlanAlreadyExists`, `NoFlightPlan`); `planCount` against Principia's ten
 * decides whether a copy can be made at all. A surface offering all four at once
 * would be a surface that refuses most of its own controls a light time after
 * they are pressed, which is the thing `writeSurface` exists on the wire to
 * prevent.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why installing a composed plan belongs here and not in the composer.</b>
 * A plan arrives on a craft one of three ways: empty, copied, or composed
 * elsewhere and transmitted whole. All three are the same transition, and the
 * mod says so: `principia.plan.send` CREATES the slot when the craft holds none,
 * rather than refusing and making the operator send a create first from a light
 * time away. So install and create differ only in whether there are burns in the
 * box, and they share the one field neither the composer nor the burn editor
 * holds: where the plan is asked to end. The composer's own upload is a
 * different destination entirely, stock manoeuvre nodes, and that is why it
 * stays where it is rather than growing a second button.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>There is one plan-end field on this panel and it is not always this
 * one.</b> A plan that exists already has an end, and the control that MOVES it
 * belongs beside the shortfall it remedies, which is `PlanIntegrationBlock`. So
 * the field here appears only for a craft with no plan, and once there is one its
 * own end is the end every write reads. Two fields under one name on one panel is
 * two answers to the same question.</p>
 *
 * <p>The burns themselves are edited in `BurnEditor` below, which works inside
 * whichever slot this names. Nothing here reads or writes a burn.</p>
