/**
 * The producer's own adjective phrase for an orbit: "circular Kerbin orbit",
 * "retrograde polar Duna orbit".
 *
 * <p>Assembled here rather than on the wire because it is a sentence, and a
 * sentence is presentation. Every threshold below is the producer's own, so the
 * phrase on this board and the title of its window agree word for word, which is
 * the whole reason this Uplink reads the producer's analysis instead of deriving
 * one.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Read from the band ENDS, never a midpoint.</b> Circular is
 * "eccentricity never exceeds 0.01 over the window", not "averages under it". An
 * orbit whose eccentricity swings from 0 to 0.4 is not circular, and a midpoint
 * test calls it nearly so.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Synchronous, stationary and semi-synchronous are reachable and are
 * said.</b> They used to be listed as impossible, on the belief that they needed
 * a recurrence hypothesis this Uplink refused to supply. They do not: the
 * producer fits a recurrence itself and derives the equatorial crossings from
 * it, and the crossings' drift is what decides all three.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Sun-synchronous is said too, and reads different data.</b> It is decided
 * by the LOCAL SOLAR TIME at the nodes holding steady, not by the ground track
 * repeating: an orbit can repeat its track without holding its lighting, and hold
 * its lighting without repeating its track. So it joins the other adjectives
 * rather than competing with them, and every one of the four the widget used to
 * disclaim is now reachable.</p>
