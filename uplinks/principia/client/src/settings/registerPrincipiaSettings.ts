/*
 * Principia's session configuration, as settings rows.
 *
 * <b>Whose numbers these are.</b> Every one of them is the in-game plugin's,
 * read off the plugin itself. None of them describes how this console renders
 * anything, and none can be changed from here. That matters most for the four
 * rows naming an integration tolerance or a step limit, because our own n-body
 * propagator has a step budget of the same name: those four say "in-game" in the
 * LABEL rather than only in a comment, since a step limit read in isolation is
 * otherwise indistinguishable from a drawing budget an operator could raise.
 *
 * Every row here is `stream-backed` and therefore read-only: the values arrive
 * on `principia.settings`, a `DelayRole.TrueNow` Topic, and the console has no
 * writer for any of them. That is not a limitation being worked around, it is
 * what these rows ARE. A plotting frame, an integration tolerance and a step
 * limit decide what every other number on the board means, and an operator who
 * cannot see them is reading numbers whose basis is hidden.
 *
 * Two of the values are stronger than a settings row usually is. The per-vessel
 * prediction bounds and the per-plan integrator bounds are read from the
 * producer's own plugin rather than off its sliders, so they are what that
 * vessel's prediction ACTUALLY used, not what a control was last set to.
 *
 * Every field the payload carries has a row here. The settings surface is the
 * FLOOR: a setting that exists is reachable from it, and a row is never left
 * out on the grounds that some widget is a better home for it. Whether a
 * setting also earns a place beside the readout it qualifies is a separate
 * question, decided per row and answered in a widget, and answering it "yes"
 * takes nothing away from here.
 *
 * The exceptions are the two vessel GUIDs, which are keys rather than settings
 * and whose names are carried by rows of their own. `settings-coverage.test.ts`
 * holds that list and fails on any other field with no row.
 *
 * Side-effect module: importing it runs every registration once, the same
 * lifecycle as this package's other module-load registrations.
