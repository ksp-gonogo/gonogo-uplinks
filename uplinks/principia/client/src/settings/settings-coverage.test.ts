/*
 * Completeness: a setting the mod publishes has a row on the settings surface.
 *
 * The settings tab is the FLOOR rather than one of several possible homes. A
 * field that reaches the console and appears only inside some widget is
 * reachable only by whoever placed that widget, and the operator who goes
 * looking for it where settings live does not find it. So this test asks the
 * question the other direction from the row assertions next door: not "does
 * each row work", but "is anything on the wire missing a row at all".
 *
 * It does that WITHOUT a hand-written list of surfaced fields, because a list
 * like that is the thing that silently stops matching the code. Two mechanisms
 * instead:
 *
 *   1. `EVERY_FIELD` is typed `Required<PrincipiaSettings>`, so a field added to
 *      the contract fails to compile here until it is filled in. That is what
 *      makes `Object.keys` on it a trustworthy enumeration of the payload.
 *   2. Which field a row reads is DISCOVERED by putting one field at a time
 *      through every row's own `select` and watching what changes, rather than
 *      declared. A row that stops reading a field stops covering it here, even
 *      though its own literals never changed.
 *
 * The only declaration is {@link NOT_A_SETTING}, and it is short on purpose.
