/**
 * Composing a flight plan at the command centre and sending it to a REAL game.
 *
 * <p>This is the journey that was driven by hand on 2026-08-24 and found three
 * faults stacked behind each other: `Value`s on the wire where the receiving
 * side binds doubles, a refusal that rendered as an empty box so none of it was
 * visible, and three Δv fields labelled by the wrong basis. Written down as a
 * spec so the next person watches it back rather than re-deriving it.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>It asserts against the game, not the widget.</b> A widget that says it
 * sent a plan and a vessel that holds one are different claims, and it was
 * exactly that gap the hand-driven run kept falling into: the status line read
 * the same whether the plan had landed or the uplink had been latched
 * unavailable twenty minutes earlier.</p>
