// A plan fact that could not be read must not reach an operator as a fact.
//
// ReflectedPrincipiaPlugin's three decoders used to answer 0, 0.0 and false on a
// type mismatch, which is what a reflected call hands back when the producer has
// moved a return type between releases and the call still resolves. Every one of
// those defaults is a POSITIVE claim, and they were claims an operator acts on:
//
//   A zero anomalous count says the integrator flagged nothing, so a plan it had
//   flagged carried no ANOM badge on any burn.
//
//   A zero plan count and a zero selection render the badge "PLAN 1 OF 0".
//
//   A false optimisation state says a write is safe to send. The inverse is
//   worse: `null >= 0` is false, so the guard that refuses a write Principia
//   would revert fell straight through on an answer nobody got.
//
//   A false Executing withheld the BURNING badge from a burn that may have been
//   under thrust, and handed out the edit and remove controls for it.
//
//   A false FrameEditable put "FRAME LOCKED" on screen as a property of a frame
//   this build never read.
//
// The refusals are the half that writes. PrincipiaBurnRules.RejectExecuting used
// null to mean "no refusal", which is the same word it uses for "nothing was
// wrong", so a REMOVE dispatched against a burn whose instants would not read
// came back Written and the operator's own console confirmed it had deleted a
// burn that may have been burning.
