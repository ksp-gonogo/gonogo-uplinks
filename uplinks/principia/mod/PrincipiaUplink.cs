// The [SitrepUplink("principia")] uplink: detection, plus the flight plan.
//
// Presence is still conveyed by system.uplinks health (Health() below) rather than
// by a principia.available topic, because nothing needs one: a client gates on the
// flight-plan channel carrying a sample, which is a stronger fact than the mod being
// loaded.
//
// It is ALSO the answer to a narrower question. `VesselPhysicsMode.IsPrincipiaActive`
// was deleted in the Major 2 -> 3 bump because "core detecting a specific
// third-party mod was a mod-seam violation; that awareness belongs to a future
// Principia Uplink instead". This is that Uplink, and detection is the whole of
// what it owns: nothing in core learns the mod's name, and the substantive fact
// reaches clients as a property of the ANSWER (an integrated trajectory, bounded
// by a horizon) rather than as the vendor's identity.
