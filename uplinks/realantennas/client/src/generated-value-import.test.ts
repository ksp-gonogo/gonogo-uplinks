// plan's Unit guard: a wire-visible Value<"..."> in this Uplink's OWN
// generated contract must still resolve to the core unit-system module
// (@ksp-gonogo/sitrep-sdk), never a locally hand-rolled Value type. See
// RealAntennasRtConfig.Configure's `valueImportFrom` argument, which is the
// mechanism this test verifies actually took effect in the emitted file, not just
// in the C# call site.
//
// The densest slice of the seven on units, and the least at risk of going
// vacuous: FOUR properties across three types retype (a ratio, two bit rates, a
// decibel margin), so every interface here carries at least one Value. Each is
// pinned by name below anyway, because "the file has some Value in it" would
// survive three of the four silently reverting to bare numbers.
