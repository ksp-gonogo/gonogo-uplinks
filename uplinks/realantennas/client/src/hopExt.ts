// the package that also writes the sub-tree server-side (RaHopExtensions.cs),
// mirroring how an augment slot's filler "is always part of its OWN package's
// compiled program".
//
// A consuming widget imports `readRealAntennasHopExt` from this package rather than
// reaching into `hop.extensions?.realantennas` and casting at the call site.
