// GonogoRealAntennasUplink client-owned Topic registration: every Topic only
// this Uplink can source, and both halves of their unit registry.
//
// The payload types behind `comms.linkQuality` / `comms.dataRate` /
// `comms.linkMargin` live in THIS Uplink's own contract slice
// (GonogoRealAntennasUplink.Contract), not Sitrep.Contract's Comms.cs, so the
// SDK generates nothing for them and they are registered here:
//
//   • TYPE: a `declare module "@ksp-gonogo/sitrep-sdk"` augmentation adds them to
//     `TopicPayloadMap`, so `useTelemetry("comms.linkMargin")` resolves to
//     `CommsLinkMargin` in any program that statically imports this module.
//   • RUNTIME: `registerBarePrimitiveTopic(...)` at module load feeds the SDK's
//     runtime registry, so `isTopicId` / `getAllKnownTopicIds` enumerate them
//     without the SDK ever naming the strings.
//
// `index.ts` RE-EXPORTS this module (rather than importing it for side effect
// alone) so the augmentation reaches the emitted `dist/index.d.ts`: see that
// file's own comment.
//
// ## Why these three and not the rest of comms.*
//
// The comms family has two kinds of channel. Most of it is a SHARED shape that
// whichever backend wins the "comms" capability election fills: stock CommNet, or
// this Uplink's RaCommsBackend when RealAntennas is installed. Those stay in the
// SDK, generated from core, because they exist with or without this mod. These
// three are the ones no election can produce: they are declared in this Uplink's
// OWN manifest and published by it directly, and without RealAntennas installed
// they simply never emit. That is the line the relocation drew, and it is why
// this was a partial extract rather than a file move.

// Unlike the slice before it, this one has real quantities to carry: a ratio, two

// `registerTopicUnits` is not merely restoring a LOOKUP here, it is restoring
// HYDRATION: without it `wrapTopicPayload` hands back bare numbers while the
// generated types still say `Value<"dB">`, and a margin renders as "3.5" next to
// a ratio that also renders as "0.9". `topics.test.ts` proves that by decoding a
// real frame, which is the check the previous slice could not make.
//
// `registerTypeUnits` is the type-keyed half, and it is now load-bearing rather
// than provisional: the fallback chain nests `RealAntennasTargetStep[]` inside
// both the chain channel and the chain command, so `GENERATED_*_SHAPES` carry a
// real entry each. It was wired before anything in the slice nested, on the
