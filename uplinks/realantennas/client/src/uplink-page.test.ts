 * The generated page, gated without a browser. `docs/uplink-rendering.md` has the
 * argument; the short version is that whether the prose matches the registrations
 * is a registry read, and only the pictures need Chromium.
 *
 * Every client-bearing Uplink carries this file, and `scripts/uplink-docs-gate.mjs`
 * is what says so. It has to run in the Uplink's own process rather than as one
 * repo-wide walk: the registries are global, so a second client loaded beside this
 * one would be read as a host of it and the page would describe both.
