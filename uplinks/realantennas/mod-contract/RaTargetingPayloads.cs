// ====================================================================
// The antenna-TARGETING half of this Uplink's contract: one observation
// channel and the args of the two commands that write to it.
//
// Targeting is per-ANTENNA in RealAntennas. There is no vessel-level target,
// no primary antenna and no arbitration: the state is one field on one
// antenna, and the link solver considers every compatible pair of antennas
// across every pair of nodes, so two dishes on one craft aimed two ways give
// two candidate links. That is why the channel is an array keyed by antenna
// and both commands address a single antenna, rather than a craft.
//
// R7 discipline as elsewhere in this slice: absence is a nullable (T?), never
// a NaN/0/-1 sentinel.
// ====================================================================
