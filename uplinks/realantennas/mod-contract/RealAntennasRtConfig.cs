/// This Uplink's OWN codegen configuration: mirrors
/// <c>Sitrep.Contract.RtConfig.Configure</c>'s shape exactly, scoped to just
/// this assembly's three wire types, and reuses
/// <c>RtConfig.ApplyUnitValueTypes</c> the same way each earlier relocated
/// Uplink's own <c>Configure</c> does (the uplink-types-out-of-core plan's
/// mechanism, unchanged here; the plan doc names the six earlier steps, this
/// file does not, since naming a sibling Uplink would trip ITS own frontend
/// uplink-boundary token).
///
/// <para><b>It began as three types, three Topic-tagged roots, and has grown
/// past that in both directions.</b> The three link channels
/// (<c>comms.linkQuality</c>, <c>comms.dataRate</c>, <c>comms.linkMargin</c>)
/// were the whole of it, and the slice carried no command args at all, because
/// the only thing a client could do with RealAntennas was look at it. Targeting
/// added a channel and two commands, and the fallback chain added a channel, a
/// command and the slice's first NESTED types, so <c>EmitUnitMap</c>'s field
/// -&gt; nested-type SHAPE half is no longer empty. The one nested shape in the
/// comms family proper, <c>CommsHop</c>, still hangs off <c>CommsPath</c> and
/// stays core with it.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Every declared quantity here is real, which is what makes this
/// slice the mirror image of the one before it.</b> All four annotated
/// properties name a dimension the unit model resolves:
/// <see cref="CommsLinkQuality.Value"/> (<c>Units.Ratio</c>),
/// <see cref="CommsDataRate.UpBitsPerSec"/> and
/// <see cref="CommsDataRate.DownBitsPerSec"/>
/// (<c>Units.BitsPerSecond</c>), and <see cref="CommsLinkMargin.DecibelMargin"/>
/// (<c>Units.Decibels</c>). Only <see cref="CommsLinkMargin.ClosesLink"/> is a
/// non-quantity (<c>Units.Flag</c>), and it is a bool. So the retyping this call
/// exists to perform is visible in every one of the three generated interfaces,
/// and the runtime hydration below can be proved by DECODING a frame rather than
/// by inspecting a registry.</para>
///
/// <para>Invoked by <c>mod/codegen.sh</c>'s per-uplink codegen step, writing
/// into <c>mod/GonogoRealAntennasUplink/client/src/__generated__/</c>, never
/// into <c>sitrep-sdk</c>.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Runtime hydration, not just codegen.</b> A relocated Topic's
/// declared units also have to reach <c>wrapTopicPayload</c>'s runtime lookup
/// (<c>sitrep-sdk</c>'s <c>unitsForTopic</c>/<c>shapesForTopic</c>), which used
/// to read these three straight out of the SDK's own generated map because the
/// types lived in <c>Sitrep.Contract</c>. It does not any more, so this Uplink's
/// client package (<c>topics.ts</c>) calls the SDK's <c>registerTopicUnits</c>
/// AND <c>registerTypeUnits</c> at module load, feeding them the maps this
/// Configure emits below. Both halves were wired before anything in this slice
/// nested, on the grounds that the loop form would need no new call site when
/// something did, and the fallback chain's entries are what did.</para>
