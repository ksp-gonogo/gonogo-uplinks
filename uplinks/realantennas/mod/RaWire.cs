    /// <c>GonogoRealAntennasUplink.Contract</c>, and a core serializer may not
    /// reference an Uplink's assembly, so the flatten moved to the producer,
    /// where every other Uplink in this repository already does it. Without this
    /// step the POCOs would reach <c>AppendValue</c>'s <c>default</c> branch and
    /// throw <c>NotSupportedException</c> at the wire boundary, dropping the
