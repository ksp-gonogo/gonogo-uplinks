// RealFuels' contribution to the base Fuel & ΔV widget.
//
// It takes the framework's universal `fuel-status.sections` seat, which
// FuelStatus places itself (beneath the per-stage ΔV/TWR stack) rather than
// leaving to `Panel`'s end-of-body default. So the two facts that decide whether
// a burn happens sit directly under the budget that assumes it will: an operator
// reading 1,400 m/s of stage ΔV can see in the same tile whether the engine can
// be lit to spend it.
//
// Presence-gated on `realfuels.available` via `requires: "realfuels"`, and
// data-gated besides: with no engine reading the section draws nothing at all
// and FuelStatus composes exactly as it does on a stock install.
