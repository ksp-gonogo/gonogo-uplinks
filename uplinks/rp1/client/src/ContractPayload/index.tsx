 * and RP-1 fires that from a comparison it makes every draw frame. A drag across
 * its range crosses ninety-six steps and withdraws at every one.</para>
 *
 * <para>So this is not a slider. Not because dragging is dangerous here (the
 * command fires each withdrawal exactly once whatever the control looks like) but
 * because a control that looks continuous invites the gesture RP-1 punishes, and
 * an operator who learns it here will use it there.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>What it costs is said before the press, not after.</b> The requirement
 * itself is visible on the fields; the churn is not, and the churn is the half
 * RP-1 never mentions.</para>
 *
 * <para>Arm then confirm, because it is not reversible in the sense that matters:
 * setting the figure back does not bring a withdrawn offer back, it withdraws
 * another round.</para>
