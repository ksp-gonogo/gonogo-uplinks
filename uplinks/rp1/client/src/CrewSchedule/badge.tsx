/**
 * Whether this kerbal is on a course, in the corner of the card the Astronaut
 * Complex draws for them.
 *
 * <para><b>Why the corner and not the schedule underneath.</b> A kerbal RP-1 has
 * on a training course still reads `Available` to KSP's own roster, so the
 * Astronaut Complex files them under Available beside everybody who could fly
 * tomorrow, and nothing in the identity line says otherwise. The mark used to
 * ride the "Course" line in the block below, which is the right place for WHICH
 * course and the wrong place for the fact THAT there is one: the block is read
 * once an operator has settled on a kerbal, and this is the fact that decides
 * which kerbal they settle on. Scanning six cards for a free crew, the corner is
 * what is read and the block is what is skipped.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>Enrolled is not training, and the corner keeps them apart.</b> RP-1
 * builds a course and leaves it unstarted until it has its students, and a
 * course can sit that way indefinitely. A kerbal marked as training who is not
 * being trained is the reading that costs a flight, so the mark says which of
 * the two it is rather than saying "busy" for both.</para>
 *
 * <para>Nothing on a stock game, nothing for a kerbal RP-1 is not scheduling,
 * and nothing for one who is on no course: an empty corner is the normal state
 * of most cards on most careers, and a grey "no course" chip on every one of
 * them would spend the corner on the answer nobody is looking for.</para>
