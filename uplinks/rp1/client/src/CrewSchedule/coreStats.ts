/**
 * What RP-1 considers as core about the Astronaut Complex as funds, the hire
 * price and the roster cap.
 *
 * <para>Those three are the whole of what STOCK has to say about a complex, and
 * they are the whole of what the host widget's own strip carries. Under RP-1 the
 * complex is a scheduling problem: the number an operator wants first is how
 * much of the roster is unavailable because it is mid-course, and the second is
 * how many qualifications are about to expire out from under a crew that is
 * currently assigned. Neither is derivable from the stock roster, and neither
 * belongs in the vanilla widget's own code.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>Data, not React.</b> These are `StatEntry` rows on the host widget's
 * `astronaut-complex.readouts` contribution slot, so it draws them with its own
 * `Stat` in its own grid and a figure of RP-1's lands in the same row and the
 * same treatment as the vanilla three. An augment would have rendered its own
 * markup into a slot beside them, which is how a strip ends up reading as two
 * widgets sharing a line.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>The settings are HONOURED, not reported.</b> A save with mission
 * training switched off has no perishable training at all: RP-1 stops checking
 * it, so a lapse count there is a number about a mechanic nobody is running.
 * The cell is absent rather than reading zero.</para>
