 * drawn on the ROSTER ROW of each student, which meant a course two kerbals
 * share was rendered twice: two copies of its name, its progress and its finish
 * date, and two copies of a cancel button that ends the same single course. The
 * roster row's question is "where is this kerbal", and it answers that in one
 * line now; the course's own specifics, and the acts that are about the course
 * rather than about a kerbal, are here.</para>
 *
 * <para>It renders nothing when the career is running no courses, which is most
 * of a career: an empty section titled TRAINING COURSES is a row of chrome
 * saying nothing.</para>
 *
 * <para>The date a course FINISHES is not the date its crew can fly. RP-1
 * grounds each student for 120% of the course's length from the moment it
 * starts, so the students come free later, and that is the date a flight gets
 * planned against. Both are drawn because an operator watching a course and an
 * operator crewing a vehicle are asking different questions of it.</para>
