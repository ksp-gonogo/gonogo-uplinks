                `GUILayout.Button` per `TrainingTemplate`; pressing one opens
                that course with the roster underneath it, the students are

                That difference is not cosmetic. A `<select>` shows ONE training

                A list rather than the chips the students use, because a training
                is named in full ("Mission training: Gemini") where a kerbal is
