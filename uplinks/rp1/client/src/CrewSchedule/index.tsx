/**
 * One kerbal's RP-1 schedule, rendered into the Astronaut Complex row the host
 * widget already drew for them.
 *
 * <para>An RP-1 career is substantially a personnel-scheduling game and none of
 * it reached an operator. A kerbal has a date their career ends, a date the
 * training that qualifies them for a mission lapses, and a course they may be
 * halfway through, and every one of those decides whether a crew can fly the
 * vehicle currently being integrated. The Astronaut Complex under stock rules
 * has nothing to say about any of them, because stock has none of the
 * concepts.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>Dates only, and no controls.</b> A roster row's question is WHERE
 * this kerbal stands, and it answers that in at most three lines. It used to
 * carry a training picker and two leave buttons as well, which put a full
 * enrolment form on every idle naut and rendered one shared course's cancel
 * button once per student. The way onto a course is `enrolment.tsx`, which can
 * name a whole crew where a row can only ever name one kerbal; the specifics of
 * a running course, and the two ways off it, are `courses.tsx`.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>No tab strip of its own, and no box either.</b> This renders inside
 * ONE roster row, and the Astronaut Complex builds a tab per crew standing
 * around those rows: the scenes press "Active" to reach them. A second tab strip
 * inside a row would be tabs over one kerbal, under the tabs that already sort
 * the kerbals. It used to draw a `Card` so the block read as one thing rather
 * than as loose lines; the host widget draws the roster row as a card now, so
 * a card here is a box inside a box, and what holds the lines together instead
 * is that each of them names itself.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>Labelled readings, not sentences.</b> Every line was a whole sentence
 * in `ReadoutCaption`, which is uppercase and muted by construction: three of
 * them in a column read as one undifferentiated block of shouted grey, with the
 * dates, the part an operator is actually looking for, drawn no louder than the
 * words introducing them. `DataLine` splits each one into the quiet half and the
 * reading, and aligns the three labels into a column so the readings start at
 * the same place.</para>
 *
 * <para>It carries no standing and draws no fatality distinction. Whether a
 * kerbal is RETIRED rather than dead rides the stock roster's own `standing`
 * field through the crewStanding capability, so the host widget has already
 * put a retiree in their own tab before this renders. That is deliberate: a
 * widget that has never heard of RP-1 must not report a retiree as a fatality,
 * and it could not have been fixed from here.</para>

 * per kerbal so the two states both exist.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>It used to say "extendable to", which an operator read as an offer
 * and went looking for the control.</b> There is no control, in RP-1 or
 * anywhere: <c>CrewHandler.IncreaseRetireTime</c> is the only writer of an
 * extension and it has exactly two callers in the shipped assembly,
 * <c>TrainingCourse.CompleteCourse</c> and
 * <c>CrewHandler.VesselRecoveryProcessing</c>. Both are consequences of
 * something that has already happened: a course whose clock ran out, and a
 * crewed vessel coming home. RP-1's own Astronaut Complex has no extend button
 * either, and its hire popup says the same thing in words ("Retirement will be
 * delayed the more interesting training they undergo and flights they fly").
 * So the line names the two mechanisms instead of implying a press, which
