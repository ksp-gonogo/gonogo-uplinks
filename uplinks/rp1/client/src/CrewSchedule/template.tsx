 * up to two templates per crewed part and names them
 * <c>"Proficiency: &lt;part&gt;"</c> and <c>"Mission: &lt;part&gt;"</c>; the enum
 * behind them is <c>TrainingTemplate.TrainingType</c>, whose two members are
 * <c>Proficiency</c> and <c>Mission</c>. Rendering that second name raw puts the
 * word "MISSION" beside a duration and a seat count, which reads as a flight
 * lasting thirty days rather than as the training for one. RP-1's own prose form
 * says the longer thing (<c>GetPrettyCourseName</c> answers "Mission training
 * for "), and so does this.</para>
 *
 * <para>The difference is worth the extra word because the two behave
 * differently in the one way an operator plans around: a proficiency is a
 * permanent qualification on the part, while mission training LAPSES a set
 * interval after the course completes and has to be taken again. A kerbal's row
 * says when theirs lapses; this says which kind can.</para>

 * check at all.</para>
