 * RP-1's two ways off a course, drawn on the COURSE rather than on the nauts.

 * why they sit here: cancelling ends the course and takes every student on it
 * off, so it is about the course; removing takes one named student off and
 * leaves it running for the rest, so there is one of it per student. Drawn on a
 * roster row instead, the cancel appeared once per student and said "2 off" from
 * both of them, which is one act rendered twice.</para>
 *
 * <para>Neither grants anything, which is on the confirm wording rather than in
 * a warning: RP-1 short-circuits a cancelled course's reward block, and a
 * student who leaves early has no course to be rewarded by.</para>
 *
 * <para>Remove is dark on a course RP-1 seats more than one kerbal on, because
 * taking one out would strand the rest below its minimum, and that is the
 * refusal RP-1 expresses by not drawing the button at all.</para>
