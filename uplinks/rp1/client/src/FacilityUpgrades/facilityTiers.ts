/**
 * RP-1's tiers, into the host widget's own facility grid.
 *
 * <para><b>The grid above this Uplink's section used to be empty in flight, and
 * this is why.</b> `career.status.facilities` is read off the live
 * `UpgradeableFacility` objects, which KSP instantiates in the SPACECENTER scene
 * only, so away from the space centre every tier and price on it is absent. That
 * is not a gap the host widget could close for itself: stock's off-scene fallback,
 * `ProtoUpgradeable.GetLevel()`, returns a NORMALISED level, and its sibling
 * `GetLevelCount()` answers -1 when the scene has no buildings in it, so there is
 * no tier count to denormalise against. RP-1 has one, out of its own config, and
 * bills the career off it in all four scenes.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>It DISPLACES the host widget's rows rather than joining them.</b>
 * The widget contributes its own reading of the stock channel at priority 0;
 * this one takes the default, so wherever RP-1 answers the grid is RP-1's and
 * there is no second copy of the same nine buildings underneath. Where RP-1 is
 * not running the contribution is not registered at all and the grid is the
 * host widget's own.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>It is typed from its own deps.</b> A contribution is handed the
 * payloads of the topics it declares in `deps`, so these rows arrive as
 * `Rp1FacilityEntry[]`, the shape `Rp1ScCapture.BuildFacilities` writes. Every
 * field on it is optional, which is the real uncertainty and the one worth
 * checking: a row is carried only once its facility and both its tiers read,
 * and dropped rather than defaulted otherwise.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>A building RP-1 does not upgrade still gets its tier and never gets a
 * price.</b> `upgradedByRp1` is false for the five its config prices at a single
 * fund under a "cosmetic only" comment: RP-1 drives their tier itself from the
 * mean of the ones it does upgrade. The tier is a reading and is reported; the
 * price would be for a step nothing will take, so it is withheld and the grid
 * draws no control beside it.</para>
