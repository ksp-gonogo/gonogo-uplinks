 * The tier an RP-1 career can commit to next, beside the host widget's grid of

 *
 * <para><b>Nothing is charged when this is pressed, and that is the fact the
 * whole section is worded around.</b> RP-1 does not sell a facility upgrade: it
 * adds a construction project, and `ConstructionProject.AddProgress` draws the
 * funds down as the work advances, throttling itself to whatever fraction the
 * career can meet at the time. So a short career gets a SLOWER upgrade, never a
 * refused one, and there is no affordability verdict here of any kind. The host
 * widget's own stock control has one and is right to: `career.facility.upgrade`
 * buys a tier outright, which is a different act at a different price, and
 * `Rp1CareerProjectGate` refuses it under a managed save for exactly that
 * reason.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>The balance is in this section rather than borrowed from the host
 * widget.</b> The construction queue beside this one deliberately leans on the
 * host widget's figure, because it carries no control at all. This one carries
 * the press, and the host widget draws its balance only once it is four rows
 * tall, so a short Space Center would show a commitment with no money on
 * screen.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>The tiers come off `rp1.facilities`, not off
 * `career.facilities`, and that is what lets this section answer away
 * from the space centre.</b> The stock channel reads the live
 * `UpgradeableFacility` objects, which KSP puts in the SPACECENTER scene only;
 * RP-1 reads the level KSP persists in the SAVE and denormalises it against its
 * own config tier count, which is what its upkeep pass does in all four scenes.
 * The stock channel is still read as a fallback, for a career whose RP-1 cost
 * table has not loaded.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>The press is readable off-scene too, and used to be refused there on
 * a claim that did not hold.</b> Queueing was thought to need the live facility
 * for `GetUpgradeCost()` and for the level table that sets the build's duration.
 * Both come out of `Database.FacilityLevelCosts` instead, which is where these
 * rows already get their price, so `rp1.facility.upgrade` now queues from
 * wherever the operator is standing and its requirement asks whether ANY source
 * can price a tier. See `Rp1FacilityUpgradeCommands`' header for the
 * member-by-member equivalence.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>One of RP-1's two refusals is now drawn before the press and the
 * other still cannot be.</b> RP-1 declines to upgrade five of the nine buildings
 * as buildings at all, and `rp1.facilities[].upgradedByRp1` carries that off
 * `Database.LockedFacilities`, so those rows are no longer offered. It also
 * gates individual tiers behind tech nodes from its own `KCTBUILDINGTECHS`
 * config, and that answer lives on a private Harmony patch class nothing puts on
 * the wire, so a row for a gated tier is offered and RP-1 refuses it in its own
 * words naming the node. That is the pressable-until-refused rule the build
 * controls follow, and it is the honest shape while the wire is silent.</para>

     does not read a building that way: it denormalises the level KSP persists in
