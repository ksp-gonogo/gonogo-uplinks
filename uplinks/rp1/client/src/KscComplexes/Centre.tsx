 * ONE space centre, and the launch complexes at it.

 * <para>The middle rung of RP-1's hierarchy, and the one stock KSP has no
 * counterpart for. Stock has a set of buildings; RP-1 has a set of buildings per
 * CAREER, then a centre, then complexes at that centre, and every staffing
 * question is asked at a different one of those three. This block is what makes
 * the middle one visible: a heading naming the place, the pool of engineers it
 * holds that no complex has claimed, and its complexes nested under it.</para>
 *
 * <para>The idle pool gets a cost of its own beside the centre's total. RP-1
 * pays an unassigned engineer a fraction of full salary for no work, so the pool
 * is a standing charge rather than a reserve, and the figure is the one an
 * operator weighs an assignment against. It is also exactly the number a
 * complex's crew here can grow by.</para>
