 * The career's standing hire instruction: keep hiring until the staff reaches a

 * <para><b>Nothing is charged at the press, and no affordability verdict belongs
 * here.</b> Read on the shipped RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll:
 * <c>HireStaffProject.IncrementProgress</c> runs every tick and hires
 * <c>min(applicants + (funds - reserve) / perHire, left)</c>, so a career that
 * cannot pay for the whole target hires what it can and comes back for the rest.
 * A short balance SLOWS the instruction; it never refuses it. What the operator
 * needs is therefore the BOUND on the spend rather than a yes or no, and the
 * bound is exact: hiring stops at the reserve, so it can draw at most the
 * balance minus the reserve.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>The reserve is the whole reason a standing order is safe to give</b>,
 * and it is the operator's number rather than RP-1's. Without one the career
 * would buy staff until the money ran out, which is why the command refuses an
 * instruction that omits it and why the field is not optional here.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>One instruction per career, so set and cancel are one control.</b>
 * RP-1 keeps a single <c>staffTarget</c>; a second one silently discards the
 * first. So whichever of the two is the legal move is the one drawn, and the
 * form is never offered beside the target it would overwrite.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>The kind is the absence of a complex, not a field.</b> RP-1 stores no
 * flag saying whether an instruction hires researchers or engineers: it names a
 * launch complex, or it does not. So the picker sends <c>lcId</c> or omits
 * it.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>Absent, not empty, on a save with no funding.</b> Hiring is a funds
 * mechanic bounded by a funds reserve, and a sandbox career has neither, so
 * asking an operator to bound a spend that cannot happen is worse than not
 * offering the control.</para>
