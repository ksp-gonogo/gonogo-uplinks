 * Renovating a launch complex the career already has.
 *
 * <para><b>Nothing is spent at the press, so there is no affordability
 * verdict.</b> A construction under RP-1 is not a purchase: the project is added
 * to its queue and funds are drawn AS IT BUILDS, at a rate that falls when the
 * career is short. So a complex cannot overdraw a career, an up-front check
 * would refuse work RP-1 itself would happily start and simply run slowly, and a
 * balance that does not cover the quote is a pace problem. That is the same
 * reading `PadNewControl` and `NewComplexControl` state, in the same words.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>YOU PAY TO DOWNGRADE, and that is said out loud.</b> RP-1 charges half
 * the difference in both halves for a reduction, plus a floor of 1,000 funds for
 * any movement of the tonnage limit at all. An operator shrinking a complex is
 * the one most likely to expect money back, so the quote names the case rather
 * than leaving a bill to be discovered.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>IT TAKES THE COMPLEX'S WHOLE CREW OFF</b>, which is not a side effect
 * chosen here: RP-1 does <c>ChangeEngineers(lc, -lc.Engineers)</c> as the first
 * thing it does and pops a dialog saying so afterwards. The count is beside the
 * press instead, where it can still change the answer, and the toggle that puts
 * them back is next to it.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>The fluids are sent back unchanged, and the control does not offer to
 * edit them.</b> `Rp1ComplexModifyArgs.resources` is a SET and absent means NONE,
 * so a renovation that says nothing about them strips every one. Editing them
 * would need a price this wire does not carry for a renovation (the per-unit
 * figures on `rp1.lcPricing` are a PAD BUILD's, and there is no hangar twin at
 * all), and quoting a renovation under its true cost is worse than not offering
 * the field. So the current set goes back verbatim and the quote's resource half
 * is exactly zero.</para>
 *
 * <para>ABSENT when RP-1 has not said what the complex holds. Absent is not
 * empty: renovating on a guess of "no fluids" would strip whatever it actually
 * has.</para>
