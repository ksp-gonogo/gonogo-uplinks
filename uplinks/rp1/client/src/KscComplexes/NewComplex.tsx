 * rather than strict.</b> The tonnage, the envelope and the human rating are all
 * PRICED: human rating alone multiplies the pad half by 1.5 and the integration
 * half by 2, so a substituted default would silently halve or double the price of
 * the thing being bought. The tonnage does something worse than cost money, and
 * the form says so: RP-1 records it as `massOrig` and holds every later renovation
 * between half and twice it, for the life of the complex.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>The centre is the one choice RP-1 does not offer.</b> Its own window has
 * no picker and builds wherever the game's camera happens to be. A career under
 * KSCSwitcher has several, and a command dispatched from a remote vantage cannot
 * mean "wherever you are looking", so the wire records which was chosen. With one
 * centre the form picks it and says which.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>The price is quoted live and the press does not spend it.</b> See
 * `lcCost.ts` for why the arithmetic is here, and `PadNewControl` for what a
 * shortfall actually does: RP-1 draws a construction down as it builds and slows
 * rather than refuses, so a balance that does not cover this is a pace problem.</para>
