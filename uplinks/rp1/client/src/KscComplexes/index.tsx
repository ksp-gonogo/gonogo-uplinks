 * RP-1's space centres, their launch complexes, and the management of both.
 *
 * <para><b>The hierarchy is the subject.</b> RP-1 has three layers where stock
 * has one, and an operator who cannot tell them apart cannot act on any of them:
 *
 * <list type="bullet">
 * <item>the FACILITIES are one set per career, drawn by the host widget above
 * this section: one VAB, one R&amp;D, one Mission Control, whatever the career
 * owns;</item>
 * <item>a SPACE CENTRE is a place, with its own pool of hired engineers. A
 * career has one until KSCSwitcher gives it more;</item>
 * <item>a LAUNCH COMPLEX is one of several AT a centre, with its own crew, its
 * own build envelope, its own efficiency and its own rush mode.</item>
 * </list>
 *
 * So this section is drawn as that nesting rather than as a flat list, and every
 * complex says which centre it belongs to even in the common case of one.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>Staffing is the fact it exists to make visible.</b> RP-1 advances a
 * complex's work at <c>Engineers / MaxEngineers</c>: a complex with nobody
 * assigned builds NOTHING however many engineers the career has hired, and an
 * engineer assigned to nothing draws salary for no work. Neither is visible
 * anywhere else on the dashboard, and both are changed from here.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>Everything here is a reading.</b> The mechanics behind these figures
 * are RP-1's to document; what an operator at the console needs is the number,
 * so the idle pool arrives as a cost per day on the centre that holds it and
 * rushing arrives as terms on the complex that is rushing. Nothing on this
 * surface explains how the mod works.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>The payroll used to be a widget of its own</b> and is a section here
 * now, on the operator's ruling: staffing a complex IS complex management, and a
 * standalone payroll panel left the hiring totals in one place and the
 * assignments that spend them in another. Its scenes came with it.</para>
 *
 * <para>The balance every control here spends against is the host widget's,
 * drawn once in its header. Assignment spends nothing at the moment it lands and
 * rushing spends nothing either; what both change is the rate the payroll runs
 * at, which the cost lines carry.</para>
