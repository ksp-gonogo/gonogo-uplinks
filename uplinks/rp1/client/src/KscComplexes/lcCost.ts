 * something that already exists and so has somewhere to be attached. A new
 * complex is priced against what the operator is still typing. Asking the mod per
 * keystroke is not available: these commands are delay-aware, and a career
 * commanding from a remote vantage would wait minutes for each quote, so a form
 * that could not price until a round trip returned could not price at all.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>The split is by whether the arithmetic needs GAME DATA.</b> What is
 * below touches none: it is a closed form over the tonnage, the envelope and the
 * human rating the operator entered, transcribed from `LCData.GetCostStats` in the
 * shipped RP0.dll and pinned by tests against the same cases the C#
 * `Rp1LcCostModel` is pinned to. The resource term is NOT transcribed, because its
 * factors come from a RealFuels tank definition, a KSP resource definition and an
 * RP-1 settings dictionary; those arrive per resource on `rp1.lcPricing` as a
 * funds-per-unit figure, which is exact rather than approximate because RP-1's own
 * expression is linear in the amount.</para>
 *
 * <para>A quote is refused rather than estimated when anything it needs is
 * missing. A form that quoted a complex under its true cost would be worse than
 * one that quoted nothing.</para>
