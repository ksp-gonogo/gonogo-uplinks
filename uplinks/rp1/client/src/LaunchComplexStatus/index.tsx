 * What RP-1 knows about ONE pad, beside the pad's own row.
 *
 * <para>Stock's answer to "what is on this pad" is a vessel sitting at PRELAUNCH,
 * and RP-1's is three facts stock has no counterpart for: which launch complex
 * owns the pad, what the pad is currently doing, and which vehicle is standing
 * on it or on its way. The host widget reads the first from
 * <c>spaceCenter.launchSites</c>; the rest live here.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>Not the vehicle's build state.</b> Whether a vehicle has been
 * integrated is a fact about the vehicle and belongs where the vehicles are.
 * This section used to answer it, off the warehouse alone, and so called a
 * vehicle that had finished rolling out "BUILT, in the warehouse, ready to roll
 * out" while the operator could see it standing on the pad: a finished rollout
 * leaves the vehicle in the warehouse list and takes its operation away, and
 * nothing in a warehouse row says where the vehicle physically is.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>This augment is advisory and says so.</b> It renders next to the
 * launch control; it does not gate it. gonogo is multi-screen and the command
 * is reachable from any surface that dispatches it, so a warning here is advice
 * to one client. The refusal belongs at the actuator, and that is the gate seam
 * rather than a widget.</para>
