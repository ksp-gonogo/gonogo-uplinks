// Sampling RP-1's funding curve for a chart.
//
// The wire carries the curve as twelve Hermite KEYS rather than as a sampled
// series, because a resampling is a rendering choice and baking one into the
// wire would fix the resolution of every chart drawn from it. That leaves the
// evaluation here, and the evaluation is RP-1's own: `HermiteCurve.Evaluate`,
// which is the normalised cubic Hermite basis between the bracketing keys plus
// a clamp to the end keys' values outside the curve's range.
//
// The Uplink evaluates the same arithmetic in C# to build the per-year payment
// schedule, and that duplication is deliberate rather than an oversight. The
// schedule is a figure RP-1 itself displays, so one implementation of it belongs
// next to the disassembly; the SHAPE between year boundaries is what a chart
// exists to show, and no schedule can carry it. Both are pinned against the
// same shipped keys, so the two cannot drift apart without a test going red.
