 * researchers work it over weeks at a rate, in an order, and the era the node
 * belongs to changes how fast. The tech tree renders a node as owned or not
 * owned, so a node being actively researched is invisible there, and so is the
 * queue it is waiting behind.</para>
 *
 * <para>No first-party change was needed for this. `Panel` mounts
 * `${componentId}.sections` for every widget, so the seam already existed; the
 * tech tree declaring no `augmentSlots` of its own turned out not to matter.</para>
