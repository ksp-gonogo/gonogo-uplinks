 * Start a node researching, beside the tech tree that can only say which ones

 *
 * <para><b>It spends SCIENCE, and all of it at the press.</b> RP-1 charges
 * `scienceCost` in full at ENQUEUE rather than on completion, so the balance
 * beside this control is the science balance and not the funds one, and the
 * charge is the whole reason a second press on a node already queued is refused
 * rather than treated as satisfied. The figure quoted here is the exact integer
 * that gets charged: RP-1 never re-prices a node and keeps no cost of its own,
 * `ResearchProject.scienceCost` is assigned straight from the tree.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>Why this rather than the tech tree's own Unlock.</b> The host
 * widget's control sends `career.tech.unlock`, which buys a node outright
 * through `ResearchAndDevelopment.UnlockProtoTechNode`. Nothing of RP-1's
 * patches that, so under a managed save the stock write would land a researched
 * node at a stock price beside a research queue that never heard of it, and
 * `Rp1CareerProjectGate` refuses it and names this command instead. Under RP-1 a
 * node is a commitment researchers work through at a rate, which is a different
 * act, so it is a different control.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>The picker enforces the prerequisites, because the command does
 * not.</b> `rp1.tech.research` builds a `ResearchProject` directly and never
 * goes through `RDTech.UnlockTech`, so nothing on its path asks whether the
 * node's parents have been researched: it would happily queue a node the tree
 * cannot reach yet. Only the client can enumerate the tree, so only the client
 * can ask, and it does, from `career.status.tech.nodes[].parents` and each
 * parent's own `unlocked` flag. This is the same derivation the host widget
 * makes for its own researchable set.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>Two of RP-1's refusals arrive at the press rather than before
 * it.</b> The science-cost ceiling the R&amp;D complex imposes
 * (`GameVariables.GetScienceCostLimit` at its normalised level) and RP-1's
 * preset switches for build and tech-unlock times are neither of them on the
 * wire, and both refuse. The press is offered anyway, which is the rule the
 * build controls follow: the command asks RP-1 itself and refuses in RP-1's own
 * words, and a refusal on the ceiling carries both figures back as a
 * LimitBreach.</para>
