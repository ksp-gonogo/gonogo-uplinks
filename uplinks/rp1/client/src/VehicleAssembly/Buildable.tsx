 * may be, whether it may carry crew, and how fast it is built, so choosing one
 * is the whole of the decision an operator is making here. It is never chosen
 * for them, for the same reason a rollout never picks the pad: a mod that
 * silently picks when the choice looks obvious has taken the decision
 * anyway.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>The eligible verdicts are a preview, not a promise.</b> They are
 * measured from the craft file without loading it, so two of RP-1's own
 * conditions cannot be applied and are not: whether the craft is human-rated,
 * which RP-1 derives from part tags, and whether the complex stocks the
 * resources it needs. An unanswerable condition therefore leaves the button
 * PRESSABLE and lets the command refuse in RP-1's own words, which is strictly
 * better than a control drawn dark for a reason nobody could establish.</para>
