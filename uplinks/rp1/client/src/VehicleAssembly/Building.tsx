 * complex does to a craft file. It was BUILD LIST, and "building" is the word
 * the Space Center's own section uses for the VAB and the pads: an operator
 * reading "Construction: nothing" above a vehicle that was visibly being built
 * had two sections claiming the same word for two different things. Nothing
 * integrates a building, so the two can now be read in one column.</para>
 *
 * <para>The half of the space centre's vehicle stock that cannot fly yet. Its
 * cards carry a clock and a bar where a warehouse card carries a rollout, and
 * the only action any of them offers is a scrap, because there is nothing else
 * RP-1 will do to a vehicle that is not finished.</para>
 *
 * <para>A second contribution rather than a branch inside the first, for the
 * reason the split exists at all: two lists that answer different questions
 * should be able to be replaced, reordered or suppressed one at a time by
 * whoever hosts them.</para>
