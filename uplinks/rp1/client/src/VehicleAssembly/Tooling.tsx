 * What tooling the vehicle being designed needs, what finishing it costs, and

 *
 * <para><b>Tooling is career-global and keyed on a SIZE, not on a part.</b> RP-1
 * holds a database of toolings, each one a type and an ordered tuple of
 * parameters, and a part is tooled when the career owns a tooling of its type
 * whose parameters match within four per cent. Two parts of one size are
 * therefore one purchase between them, and the second is free. That is the fact
 * this section is shaped around: the rows are PURCHASES, gathered from the parts
 * that need them, rather than one row per part.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>Two money figures, asking different questions.</b> A purchase's price
 * is paid ONCE. Its parts' surcharges are paid on EVERY copy of the vehicle ever
 * built, for ever, because an untooled part carries a penalty through the game's
 * own part-cost modifier. The decision an operator is making here is never "what
 * does tooling cost", it is "tool once, or pay that again on every build", so
 * both figures are on screen without either being derived from the other.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>The whole-ship price is not the sum of the rows and is not drawn like
 * one.</b> RP-1's own Tool All figure is deduplicated across the fuzzy match, so
 * paying for one size can leave a neighbouring size free and the column adds up
 * to more than the vehicle costs. It sits with the control it is the price of,
 * away from the foot of the column where a total would go.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>No affordability verdict is drawn here.</b> RP-1 charges a tooling
 * purchase through its unlock-credit pool before it reaches funds, so the funds
 * balance alone does not decide whether a price can be met, and the split is the
 * producer's to make. The command asks RP-1 and refuses in RP-1's own words. The
 * host widget draws both balances for the same reason.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>Two ways to close the gap, and the second one is free.</b> A part can
 * have its tooling bought, or it can be RESHAPED to a size the career already
 * owns. The second spends nothing at all and is the one an early career reaches
 * for, so it is offered on the part rather than left to the game's own window:
 * `rp1.tooling[].refitTargets` carries the owned sizes this part could move to,
 * already filtered by RP-1's own material picker to ones it can actually use.
 * A refit is per PART where a purchase is per SIZE, which is why the presses
 * live on the part rows and the price lives on the card.</para>
