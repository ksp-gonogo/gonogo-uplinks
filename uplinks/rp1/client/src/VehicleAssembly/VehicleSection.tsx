 * One of RP-1's two vehicle lists, headed by what it is, as a flat run of cards
 * across every launch complex.
 *
 * <para><b>Gathered by complex, without being nested under it.</b> The cards
 * are ORDERED so that everything at one complex sits together, which is what
 * makes a flat list read as grouped; the complex is not made a heading, because
 * a complex is not the subject here. It is where work is happening, and an
 * operator scanning for what is nearly finished should not have to open three
 * groups to find it. Headings would also repeat "LC-1 at Cape" once per section
 * per complex, four times over in a two-complex career, for a fact the widget
 * already states once at the top.</para>
 *
 * <para>Every card names its own complex and carries that complex's staffing
 * and rush state, which is the whole of what a heading would have told them.
 * Read-only, all of it: this widget is purely vehicle construction and rollout,
 * and the controls for staffing and rushing live where the complex itself is
 * administered.</para>
 *
 * <para>The complexes, the pads and the operations are read HERE rather than
 * passed in, because each contributed section is an independent consumer of
 * this Uplink's wire. That is what makes the two of them a working example of
 * the contribution API rather than two halves of one widget that happen to be
 * registered separately.</para>
 *
 * <para>An empty list draws nothing at all rather than an empty heading. The
 * host widget says "none built and none on order" once, for both lists together,
 * because that is one fact about the space centre rather than two.</para>
