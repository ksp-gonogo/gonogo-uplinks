/**
 * The funds rule, in the one place this widget meets it.
 *
 * <para>The repo rule is that a spend control is never visible without a
 * balance visible in the same WIDGET. Every control in this one spends or
 * refunds: a rollout is billed as the vehicle moves, a scrap pays the vehicle
 * back, and a repeat buys another. None of the sections carrying those controls
 * draws a balance, because a widget that printed the same number under three
 * headings is what the Space Center already did and the operator read the
 * repetition as the defect it was.</para>
 *
 * <para>So the whole rule rests on the host widget, and no section's own tests
 * can see it break. That is what this file holds, and it is asked of a section
 * that is NOT one of the widget's own: an outside Uplink adding a spend
 * control to this slot is covered by the same one balance, and a check that
 * only ever saw the built-in two would not say so.</para>
