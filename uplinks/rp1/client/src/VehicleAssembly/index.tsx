 * division is settled. The Space Center holds the career's INFRASTRUCTURE: the
 * global buildings and their upgrades, the space centres, the launch complexes
 * inside each, and the management of those complexes, which is who is assigned
 * where, what each level costs, and the choice to rush. Launch Director asks
 * what can fly right now. This asks what is being built and how fast. A complex
 * here is where work is happening rather than a thing being administered.</para>
 *
 * <para>So this widget administers NOTHING: no rush toggle, no staff
 * assignment, no complex level, no payroll. It shows the CONSEQUENCES of those
 * decisions, because they are what its clocks are made of. A card whose complex
 * is rushing says so, and one whose complex has nobody assigned says that
 * instead of reporting a stall an operator would go looking for a fault behind.
 * Both are read-only, and the controls for them are one widget away.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>The body is contributed, all of it.</b> Both lists arrive through
 * `rp1-vehicle-assembly.sections`, the same slot and the same registration call
 * an outside Uplink would use to add a section of its own. There is no private
 * route for first-party content, so the slot is adequate by construction rather
 * than by assertion: if the two lists can be built through it, so can anybody
 * else's.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>The balance is drawn once, here.</b> Every control in the body
 * spends or refunds career funds, and the repo rule is that a spend control is
 * never visible without a balance visible in the same widget. Drawing it on the
 * host widget is what lets each contributed section carry none: three sections
 * each with their own copy is the same rule satisfied three times in one
 * widget, which reads as a defect rather than as care.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>Starting a build lives in a section like the others.</b> It reads
 * `rp1.buildable`, which is the save's craft files measured against every
 * complex, and dispatches `rp1.build.start`. See
 * {@link RP1_BUILD_REPEAT_COMMAND} for why RP-1's own repeat command still gets
 * no control of its own.</para>
