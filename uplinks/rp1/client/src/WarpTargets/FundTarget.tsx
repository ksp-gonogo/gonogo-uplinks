 * own alarm list where it can be renamed, retargeted or deleted.</para>

 * <para><b>The figure is the operator's, typed here.</b> It is not taken from
 * RP-1's standing target alone, because with the set command gone one only
 * exists after a trip through RP-1's in-game Maintenance screen, and a control
 * that is dark until you have done the thing in-game is no control. When a

 * threshold RP-1 is working toward, and arming on it is a press rather than a
 * retype.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>It spends nothing, and no affordability line belongs here.</b> The
 * figure beside the control is the balance the alarm is MEASURED against, not a
 * price. RP-1's <c>FundTargetProject</c> returns project type <c>None</c>, its
 * <c>IncrementProgress</c> returns zero and its <c>Clear()</c> is a pure field
 * reset, so nothing on this control has ever touched a currency. Read on the

                     * at the home command, so a ground centre is told the balance

                     * own path home, which is the tick that centre learns it.
                     *
                     * What "scet" buys is PRECISION UNDER WARP, and only that. The
                     * mod's roster reads the balance on the tick and sets
                     * ScetAlarmTick.StopWarp in that same tick. The client
                     * evaluator ticks at 1 Hz, so one tick moves the game clock by
                     * the warp rate: at KSP's top stock rate a funds threshold is
                     * seen up to ~28 game-hours late, and only then pays a command
                     * round-trip to drop the warp. For an alarm whose whole job is
                     * halting a months-long RP-1 build the moment the next thing is
                     * affordable, that gap is the entire argument.
                     *
                     * So the command vantage is the honest DESCRIPTION of this
                     * alarm and still costs precision today, for two reasons that
                     * are not this widget's to fix. A command-vantage threshold is
                     * evaluated mod-side in SHADOW only, the client staying
                     * authoritative; and ScetAlarmUplink.HandleOnCourier discards
                     * an audience roster's StopWarp deliberately, on the ground
                     * that one vantage's light-time-old reading is not a fact about
                     * the simulation. That ground does not hold for a zero-delay
                     * "game" subject, where the two verdicts ARE the same verdict,
                     * but exempting one is a decision to take rather than a flip to
                     * make. Note also that the shadow read would not currently
                     * agree with this screen: Courier.ReadRawAtVantage applies
                     * DelayTo(vantage, "system"), which for a command centre falls
                     * through to the whole-network default, i.e. the ACTIVE
                     * VESSEL's signal delay, a number with nothing to do with the
                     * career.
                     *
                     * Revisit when an audience verdict can stop the warp for a
                     * subject at zero delay. Until then this stays "scet".
                     *
                     * Unconditional on purpose, and safe to be: the request is
                     * carried through untouched, armed on the mod, and fired off
                     * the simulation's own reading, at every delay including
                     * none. Under a second of light time `useTimeContexts`
                     * reports no `scet` qualifier, but that is about a LABEL on
                     * a rendered instant and nothing on the arming path consults
                     * it. Pinned by "arms and fires an Uplink's SCET threshold
