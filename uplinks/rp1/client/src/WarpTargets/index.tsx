 * with one piece of state, and the dashboard already has a control for it. RP-1
 * does not add a second kind of warp; it adds something worth warping TO, which
 * is a stop condition rather than a new concept. So this binds
 * <c>warp-control.stepper</c>, the slot that exists for exactly this, and an
 * operator reads one warp control rather than hunting for whichever panel owns
 * the mod's version.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>RP-1 drives warp for ONE thing now, and asks for an alarm for the
 * other.</b> <c>rp1.warp.toFundTarget</c> and <c>rp1.fundTarget.set</c> are
 * gone: they were one controller wearing two names, and what they achieved is
 * what a threshold alarm on the career balance achieves, in the operator's own
 * alarm list rather than under a mod's control. See
 * <c>FundTarget.tsx</c>.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>Warp-to-complete stays, and its replacement does not exist.</b>
 * Nothing publishes "the next project to finish" as an instant a threshold could
 * be armed against: the candidates live across <c>rp1.buildQueue</c>,
 * <c>rp1.constructions</c>, <c>rp1.research</c> and <c>rp1.training</c>, and a
 * dotted path cannot index a list. Deleting it would remove the capability
 * rather than relocate it.</para>
 *
 * <para><b>Nothing here stops warp.</b> RP-1's own controller destroys itself the
 * moment it sees a warp rate of zero, so the host widget's existing "1x" button
 * already ends an RP-1 warp and a second control would be two buttons doing one
 * thing. That is a decision recorded in <c>Rp1WarpCommands</c> with the IL that
 * settles it, not an omission.</para>
 *
 * <para>The press is single, not armed: warping is reversible by the button next
 * door, and an arm-then-confirm on a reversible act trains an operator to
 * double-press everything.</para>
