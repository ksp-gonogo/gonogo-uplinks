/**
 * The two RP-1 sections that put a facility's tier on screen, mounted together
 * because that is how the operator meets them: both land in
 * `SpaceCenterStatus`, one above the other, beside the host's own grid.
 *
 * <para>Every tier on the wire is KSP's own zero-based facility level.
 * `career.facilities.facilities[x].currentTier` is `UpgradeableFacility.FacilityLevel`
 * and `rp1.constructions[].currentLevel` is
 * `RP0.FacilityUpgradeProject.currentLevel`, which `Abort()` feeds straight to
 * `UpgradeableObject.SetLevel`, so the two are the same index in the same
 * domain. An operator counts from one, KSP's own R&amp;D dialog calls a fully
 * upgraded VAB "Level 3", and the host's grid draws `index + 1`. Anything here
 * that draws the raw index puts two numbers for one building on one screen.</para>
