// The rp1.* Topic registrations, both halves.
//
//   TYPE: a `declare module "@ksp-gonogo/sitrep-sdk"` augmentation adds each
//   Topic to `TopicPayloadMap`, so `useTelemetry("rp1.buildQueue")` resolves to
//   `Rp1BuildItemEntry[]` in any program that statically imports this module.
//
//   RUNTIME: `registerBarePrimitiveTopic` feeds the SDK's runtime registry, so
//   `isTopicId` and the replay recorder know these strings without the SDK ever
//   naming one, and `registerTopicUnits` feeds the decode-time unit lookup that
//   turns a bare number on the wire into the `Value<"bp">` the type promises.
//
// `rp1.available` is a bare JSON boolean with no payload type, so it never
// flows through codegen and is declared by hand here, same as every other
// Domain presence gate.
