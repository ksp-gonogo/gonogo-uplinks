// The rp1.* Topic payloads: RP-1's space-centre model, read at KSC cadence.
//
// Every channel here is held at the home command, matching the stock
// spaceCenter.* / career.* convention: this is state at a space centre, not a
// reading taken from a craft, so each vantage learns a change after its own
// delay to home. rp1.available is the exception, TrueNow, being about the
// install rather than the space centre.
//
// Two conventions run through the whole file and are the reason it reads the
// way it does.
//
// ABSENCE IS A FIRST-CLASS ANSWER. A rate RP-1 has not computed yet is null,
// never zero, because zero is a legitimate reading that means something else
// entirely. `Rate` and `Stalled` on a queue item are separate facts for exactly
// that reason: null rate is "not costed yet, ask again next tick", stalled is
// "costed, and going nowhere". Only the second is worth telling an operator.
//
// EVERY DERIVED NUMBER MIRRORS THE CODE THAT ADVANCES PROGRESS, not RP-1's own
// display helper. The helpers are unusable from a sampled capture: they reach
// LaunchComplex.Efficiency, whose getter constructs and PERSISTS an LCEfficiency
// on a cache miss. The arithmetic is reproduced from IncrementProgress instead,
// off data read read-only, and the two RP-1 defects it carries (an infinite
// time-left at zero rate, a NaN fraction at zero build points) come out as
// absent here rather than as numbers no client can render.
//
// These are TS-shape-only typing/codegen markers: the Uplink hand-builds the
// dicts and JsonWriter walks that live tree, so none of these POCOs serialize.

// IS, and which reached an operator not at all.
//
// The two channels below are joined to the stock roster by NAME
// (spaceCenter.crewRoster[].name). They deliberately do NOT restate a kerbal's
// trait, rank, courage or standing: core already publishes all of that, RP-1
// does not own any of it, and a second copy is a second thing to disagree.
//
// The one place RP-1 does own an answer core cannot reach is whether a kerbal is
// RETIRED, and that does not appear here either. It rides the stock roster's own
// `standing` field, through the crewStanding capability, because a retiree must
// not read as a fatality to a widget that has never heard of RP-1. See
// Sitrep.Contract/CrewStanding.cs.
//
// SENTINELS. RP-1's crew getters answer 0 for "no record" (GetRetireTime,
// GetRetireIncreaseTime) and -1 for "not in a course" (GetTrainingFinishTime).
// A kerbal whose retirement date is unknown is not a kerbal retiring at UT
// zero, so every one of those becomes absent here.
