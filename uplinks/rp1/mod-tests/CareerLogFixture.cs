// A stand-in for RP-1's career log, declared in RP-1's own namespace with RP-1's
// own type and member names.
//
// The ACCESSIBILITIES are the load-bearing part and are copied deliberately: all
// six event lists are PRIVATE on the real CareerLog, whose public surface is only
// Instance, IsEnabled, Scenario and a few period markers. A fixture that exposed
// them publicly would let a walk pass here that resolves nothing in a running
// game, which is the one thing this fixture family exists to prevent.
//
// The monthly financial ledger (_periodDict of LogPeriod, about thirty figures a
// period) is deliberately NOT modelled. Nothing reads it: it is a balance sheet
// rather than a timeline and belongs on a budget surface, so a fixture for it here
// would be scaffolding for a reading that does not exist.
