// The launch-complex LIFECYCLE half of the RP-1 stand-in graph: the members the
// rename, dismantle and construction commands reach, and no others.
//
// A separate file from Rp0Fixture rather than more of it, for the reason the crew
// and programs halves are separate: this is a coherent slice with its own
// reasoning, and the reasoning is what a stand-in is for. Rp0Fixture's own
// LaunchComplex, LCLaunchPad, LCSpaceCenter and SpaceCenterManagement are
// EXTENDED by partial declarations here, so the shipped shape stays in one place
// per type and the lifecycle members it grows are readable together.
//
// WHAT A STAND-IN HERE HAS TO GET RIGHT, learned from the traps this Uplink has
// already hit:
//
//   THE SHAPES THAT MAKE A READER FAIL. LCLaunchPad's ctor takes three arguments
//   and LaunchComplex's takes two, so a production caller that matched on arity
//   alone would be caught. SwitchToPrevLaunchComplex takes ONE argument (the
//   optional bool), so a reflected invoke that passed none finds nothing.
//   LCConstructions and PadConstructions are PersistentObservableList, whose Add
//   SHADOWS the base, so binding to the base one queues the project and tells
//   nobody.
//
//   THE ARITHMETIC THAT MUST BE REAL. LCData.GetCostStats and ResModifyCost are
//   reproduced from the shipped source rather than stubbed, because
//   Rp1LcCostModel's whole job is to combine them correctly and a stub would let a
//   wrong combination pass. LaunchComplex.MaxEngineersCalc is NOT reproduced: the
//   cost model only passes its answer through, so a deterministic stand-in that
//   carries no claim about RP-1's curve is the honest shape.
//
//   THE GATES THAT MUST BE DERIVED. CanDismantle and CanModifyReal are computed
//   from the same four lists the real ones read, so a fixture cannot set them
//   inconsistently with the state a test set up. That is the property that lets a
//   test prove the dismantle refuses for the RIGHT reason.
//
// PROVENANCE. Every member and every constant was read out of an ilspycmd
// disassembly of the INSTALLED RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll.
