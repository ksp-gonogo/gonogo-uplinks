// A stand-in for RP-1's crew object graph, declared in RP-1's own namespace with
// RP-1's own type and member names, so the production reflection walk resolves it
// exactly as it resolves the real thing: same FindType lookup, same private-field
// reads, same enumeration of collections as bare IEnumerable.
//
// Every name, accessibility and shape below was taken from an ilspycmd
// disassembly of the SHIPPED RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll. The accessibilities are the
// load-bearing part and are copied deliberately: _retirees, _retireTimes,
// _retireIncreases and _expireTimes are PRIVATE on CrewHandler and
// TrainingCourse.progress / .BP are private with _buildRate protected, so a walk
// that only reads public members would resolve nothing here and nothing in a
// running game either.
//
// What this CANNOT do, stated rather than implied: it proves the walk reads the
// members it claims to and derives what the arithmetic says. It proves nothing
// about the VALUES a running RP-1 would hold; there is no RP-1 install on this
// machine or the test rig.
