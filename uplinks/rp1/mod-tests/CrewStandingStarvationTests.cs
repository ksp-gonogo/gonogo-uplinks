/// capture entirely on any tick where nothing under its prefixes is subscribed.
/// A crew-standing backend answered out of state that capture stashed would
/// therefore go silent on exactly the dashboards that need it, and the failure is
/// invisible in the data: the roster keeps publishing, with stock's answer, and

/// their astronauts had died because nobody happened to be watching a build
/// queue.</para>
