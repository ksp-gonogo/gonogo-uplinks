// A stand-in for RP-1's Program object graph, declared in RP-1's own namespace
// with RP-1's own type and member names, so the production reflection walk
// resolves it exactly as it resolves the real thing: same FindType lookup, same
// private-field reads, same enumeration of collections as bare IEnumerable.
//
// Every name, accessibility and shape below was taken from an ilspycmd
// disassembly of the SHIPPED RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll, cross-checked against the
// ProgramHandler node a live RP-1 career writes to persistent.sfs. A rename on
// RP-1's side makes these tests wrong in the same direction it makes production
// wrong.
//
// Where RP-1 computes a property this stands in with a settable one: the four
// predicates (AllRequirementsMet, AllObjectivesMet, CanAccept, CanComplete) are
// compiled expressions over live tech, contract and facility state, which no
// headless test can supply. What these tests prove is that the walk reads the
// members it claims to and maps them where it says; what a running RP-1 puts in
// them is not theirs to prove.
