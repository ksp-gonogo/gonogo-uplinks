// The research half of the stand-in graph: RP-1's research project and preset,
// and the KSP types this Uplink's research command AUTHORS against rather than
// merely reads. Same contract as Rp0Fixture, whose header states it: every name,
// accessibility and shape below was taken from an ilspycmd disassembly of the
// SHIPPED RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll and of the installed Assembly-CSharp.dll, so a
// rename on either side makes these tests wrong in the same direction it makes
// production wrong.
//
// WHY THE PERSISTENCE IS REAL HERE AND NOT A SET OF EXPECTED KEYS. The whole
// case for the Load(ConfigNode) route is that its failure mode is a CHECKLIST:
// author every [Persistent] key or persist a default. A stand-in Load that read
// exactly the keys production writes would agree with whatever production wrote
// and prove none of that. So ConfigNode.LoadObjectFromConfig below is
// REIMPLEMENTED over the [Persistent] attribute, and ResearchProject.Load is
// RP-1's own two lines unchanged: a key production forgets leaves the field at
// its default, which is what the shipped game would do with it.
//
// The list is separately held to the SHIPPED assembly in
// Rp1InstalledCompatibilityTests, which reads RP0.ResearchProject's [Persistent]
// fields off the binary rather than trusting this file's copy of them.
