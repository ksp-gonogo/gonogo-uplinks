// A stand-in for the RP-1 object graph, declared in RP-1's own namespace with
// RP-1's own type and member names, so the production reflection walk resolves
// it exactly as it resolves the real thing: same FindType lookup, same public
// and non-public member reads, same enumeration of collections as bare
// IEnumerable.
//
// Every name, accessibility and shape below was taken from an ilspycmd
// disassembly of the SHIPPED RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll, so a rename on RP-1's side
// makes these tests wrong in the same direction it makes production wrong, and
// a typo here fails as loudly as a typo there.
//
// What this CANNOT do is stated plainly rather than implied: it proves the walk
// reads the members it claims to and derives what the arithmetic says, and it
// proves nothing whatever about the VALUES a running RP-1 would hold. There is
// no RP-1 install on this machine or the test rig.
