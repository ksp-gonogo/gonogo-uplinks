    /// Uplink shows is computed here, beside RP-1, because it prices something that
    /// already exists. A NEW complex is priced against what the operator is still

    /// <para><b>What this test is for.</b> A transcription drifts silently: it goes
    /// on agreeing with itself long after it has stopped agreeing with RP-1. So the
    /// cases below are computed by the SHIPPED <c>LCData.GetCostStats</c> and
    /// written to a file the client's own test reads. If RP-1 changes, this fails
    /// and the file is regenerated; if the client drifts, the client's test fails
    /// against the same file. Neither side can move alone.</para>

    /// <para>Regenerate with <c>GONOGO_WRITE_LC_COST_CASES=1</c>, and read the diff
