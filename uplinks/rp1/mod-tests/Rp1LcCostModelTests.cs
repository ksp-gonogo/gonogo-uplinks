    /// in this Uplink.</b> Everywhere else a command invokes an RP-1 method that
    /// already does the thing, and a test proves the right member was called. Here
    /// there is no method: RP-1 computes the price inline in
    /// <c>KCT_GUI.DrawNewLCWindow</c>, interleaved with the GUILayout calls that
    /// draw it, and hands three doubles to <c>ProcessNewLC</c>. So the arithmetic
    /// is ours, and a mistake in it does not throw and does not refuse: it writes
    /// a wrong price onto a construction project, and RP-1 then draws that figure
    /// out of the career's funds over the following weeks of game time.</para>
    ///
    /// <para><b>Mostly RELATIONSHIPS rather than magic numbers, on purpose.</b> A
    /// test that restates the formula and compares it to the formula agrees with
    /// itself whatever either says. So each clause of RP-1's arithmetic is pinned
    /// as the property that clause EXISTS to produce: a downgrade costs half what
    /// the same move costs upward, a tonnage change costs at least a thousand, a
    /// growth is capped at what building outright would have cost. Those hold only
    /// if the clause is present and correct, and none of them can be satisfied by
