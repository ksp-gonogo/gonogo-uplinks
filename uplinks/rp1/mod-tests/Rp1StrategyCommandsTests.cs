// What rp1.strategy.activate must do, and the two things it must not.
//
// The valuable tests here are the two ORDERING ones. Both defects the command
// was written around are invisible in a return value: performing the program
// half second mints a KAC alarm against a deadline Accept() has not assigned
// yet, and performing it at all while the Administration screen is open
// performs it twice. Both leave a career wrong and report success, so they are
// asserted on the call log rather than on the result.
//
// What these cannot prove is what every fixture-backed test here cannot prove,
// and Rp0Fixture's header says it: these stand-ins carry RP-1's names, so a
// rename stops production resolving while they go on passing. That is
// Rp1ReflectionTargets' job, against the shipped binary.
