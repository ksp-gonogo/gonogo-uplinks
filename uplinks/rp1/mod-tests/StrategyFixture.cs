// Stand-ins for the strategy types Rp1StrategyCommands reaches by name, in the
// namespaces RP-1 declares them in, so the production walk resolves these
// exactly as it resolves the real assembly.
//
// What they can and cannot prove is stated in Rp0Fixture's header and holds
// here: a rename on RP-1's side stops production resolving while these go on
// carrying the old name, which is what Rp1ReflectionTargets exists to catch
// against the shipped binary. These prove ORDER and BRANCHING, which the
// manifest cannot see at all.
//
// The recorder is the point. Both defects this command was written around are
// defects of SEQUENCE rather than of value: performing the program half second
// mints an alarm against a deadline that has not been assigned, and performing
// it at all when the screen is open performs it twice. Neither is visible in a
// return value, so the fixture writes down what was called and in what order.
