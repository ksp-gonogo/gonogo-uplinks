// RP-1's build queue, made writable. No compile-time reference to RP0.dll, the
// same arm's-length reflection pattern as Rp1ScReflection, whose header carries
// the provenance rules this file follows.
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG. Every rp1.* channel is read-only, so an operator could watch a
// launch complex integrate a vehicle and could not ask it to integrate another.
// Under RP-1 that is not a corner: a design is built once and then flown many
// times, so "build another one of these" is the single most repeated act in the
// career loop, and it was reachable only from RP-1's own in-game window.
//
// WHAT THIS IS A COPY OF. RP-1's build-list window draws a "Duplicate" button
// per vehicle whose entire body is
//
//     KCTUtilities.TryAddVesselToBuildList(vesselProject.CreateCopy(), skipPartChecks: true)
//
// and that is the action reproduced here. TryAddVesselToBuildList itself is NOT
// called, deliberately: it hands the vehicle to VesselBuildValidator, which is a
// Unity coroutine that takes an InputLockManager lock and asks its questions
// through PopupDialog. There is nobody to answer a popup on a command dispatched
// from another machine, so the checks that matter are made here and the
// validator's own success action, KCTUtilities.AddVesselToBuildList, is called
// directly. skipPartChecks is what RP-1's own Duplicate button passes, and it
// means the same thing here: the parts were available when the original was
// integrated and the copy is the same craft node.
//
// THE ONE CHECK THAT CANNOT BE SKIPPED IS THE MONEY, and it is not where it
// looks. KCTUtilities.SpendFunds does NOT test affordability: its whole body is
// a Funding.Instance.AddFunds of the negative amount. The affordability test
// lives in VesselBuildValidator.ProcessFundsChecks, which is the half of the
// validator this file does not call, so a handler that skipped it would put a
// career into negative funds and RP-1 would never complain. That is why the
// currency query below is mandatory and why an unreadable one REFUSES rather
// than proceeding: the safe direction of a failed money check is no build.
//
// THE AUTHORITY ON PRICE IS RP-1'S, NOT THE STORED COST.
// CurrencyModifierQueryRP0.RunQuery is what RP-1's own validator asks, and it is
// asked here for the same reason: leaders and strategies modify what a vessel
// purchase actually costs, so the field on the vehicle is a list price rather
// than the charge. The query fires GameEvents.Modifiers.OnCurrencyModifierQuery,
// which is a broadcast, so it is run ONCE per operator press on the main thread,
// exactly where and as often as RP-1's own window runs it. It is never run from
// a gate or a capture.
//
// WHAT IS READ, and why each is safe:
//
//   SpaceCenterManagement.Instance / .enabledForSave / .KSCs
//                                    the same three reads Rp1ScReflection opens
//                                    with, vouched for there
//   LCSpaceCenter.LaunchComplexes    [Persistent] list
//   LaunchComplex.Name/.IsOperational
//                                    plain fields
//   LaunchComplex.BuildList/.Warehouse
//                                    [Persistent] lists of VesselProject
//   VesselProject.KCTPersistentID/.shipName
//                                    plain [Persistent] fields
//   VesselProject.ShipNodeCompressed a PRIVATE field; .IsEmpty on it is
//                                    `_node == null && _bytes == null`, pure
//   Funding.Instance.Funds           read ONLY to put a number beside a refusal
//
// WHAT IS INVOKED, which is the part that makes this file different from every
// other reader in this Uplink, and each is a write RP-1 itself performs on the
// same click:
//
//   VesselProject.CreateCopy()       builds a fresh VesselProject with new
//                                    shipID and KCTPersistentID. It touches
//                                    EditorLogic ONLY on the empty-node arm,
//                                    which is why the node is tested first
//   VesselProject.GetTotalCost()     computes and memoises cost/emptyCost from
//                                    the craft node when they are zero
//   VesselProject.MeetsFacilityRequirements(List<string>)
//                                    measures the vehicle against its complex's
//                                    envelope. Reproduced from fields in
//                                    Rp1LaunchGate and INVOKED here, because that
//                                    file is a gate and this is a command; see
//                                    FacilityRefusals for the whole of that
//                                    argument
//   CurrencyModifierQueryRP0.RunQuery / .CanAfford / .GetTotal
//   KCTUtilities.AddVesselToBuildList(vp, spendFunds)
//                                    spends, sets the launch site, appends to
//                                    the complex's build list, fires
//                                    SCMEvents.OnVesselAddedToBuildQueue
//
// WHAT IS NOT REPRODUCED. The validator's part-availability, part-config,
// untooled-parts and excess-EC arms. RP-1's own Duplicate button turns the first
// three off (skipPartChecks) because a copy of an integrated vehicle has already
// passed them, and the fourth is a popup that offers to drain batteries. None of
// them can refuse a duplicate that RP-1's own button would accept.
//
// Its facility arm IS reproduced, and is the one arm of the four that had to be:
// the button leaves CheckFacilityRequirements on, and it is the only check whose
// answer can CHANGE after a vehicle is integrated, because modifying a complex
// moves the envelope it will accept.
//
// THE REST OF THE SURFACE now lives in Rp1VehicleCommands: roll out, roll back,
// scrap, and a complex's rush mode. Its header carries the same
// what-is-read/what-is-invoked accounting for those, and the two files share
// this one's gate evaluator, because all four commands turn on the same single
// static quantity (RP-1 is managing this save).
//
// RECOVER is the one item of the surface that is NOT anywhere, and deliberately:
// KCTUtilities.RecoverActiveVesselToStorage(ProjectType) acts on
// FlightGlobals.ActiveVessel and takes no id, so it is a FLIGHT-scene action
// about the craft on screen rather than a space-centre one. It is not
// addressable from the KSC at all and belongs with the flight surface.
//
// PROVENANCE. Every member named above was read out of an ilspycmd disassembly
// of the INSTALLED RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll and, for IsEmpty, ROUtils.dll. The
// disassembly verifies SHAPE and never VALUE: nothing here has been exercised
// against a running game, so every hop is null-safe and every failure to read
// refuses the command rather than guessing at it.
