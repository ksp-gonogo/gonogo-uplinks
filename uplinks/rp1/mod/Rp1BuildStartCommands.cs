// Starting a NEW design building, from one of the save's own craft files. No
// compile-time reference to RP0.dll, the same arm's-length reflection pattern as
// Rp1ScReflection, whose header carries the provenance rules this file follows.
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG. rp1.build.repeat is the only build command there was, and it
// COPIES: it resolves an existing vehicle by id, refuses when RP-1 holds no
// stored design for it, and appends the copy to that vehicle's own complex.
// Nothing in it can start from a craft file. So an operator could order a second
// Atlas and could never order a first one, which is a dead end rather than a gap:
// every career begins with nothing built, and the surface offered no way out of
// that state at all.
//
// WHAT THIS IS A COPY OF. RP-1's own editor path,
// KCTUtilities.TryAddVesselToBuildList(launchSite), whose body is
//
//     new VesselProject(EditorLogic.fetch.ship, launchSite, EditorLogic.FlagURL,
//                       storeConstruct: true)
//
// handed to VesselBuildValidator, and its Build Plans window's row, which is the
// same construction with TryAddVesselToBuildList(vp, skipPartChecks: true,
// overrideLC) so the vehicle lands at a complex chosen rather than at whichever
// one happens to be active. Both are reproduced here. The validator itself is
// NOT called, for the reason Rp1BuildCommands gives at length: it is a Unity
// coroutine that takes an InputLockManager lock and asks its questions through
// PopupDialog, and there is nobody to answer a popup on a command dispatched from
// another machine. Its checks are made here instead and its success action,
// KCTUtilities.AddVesselToBuildList, is called directly.
//
// THE FOUR CHECKS THE VALIDATOR MAKES, AND WHAT EACH BECAME. Unlike the repeat
// build, which passes skipPartChecks because a copy of an integrated vehicle has
// already been through them, a craft file has been through NONE of them. So all
// four are asked:
//
//   ProcessFacilityChecks   MeetsFacilityRequirements, INVOKED, as the repeat
//                           build invokes it and for the same reason: this is a
//                           command running at the moment of a press, which is
//                           exactly where RP-1's own button calls it
//   ProcessPartAvailability REFUSES, naming the parts. RP-1's own arm offers to
//                           spend funds unlocking them through a popup, and a
//                           command that answered that popup on an operator's
//                           behalf would spend money nobody asked it to
//   ProcessPartConfigs      REFUSES, quoting what the part modules said. The walk
//                           needs the live parts and so belongs to the craft
//                           catalogue; see below
//   ProcessFundsChecks      the currency query, mandatory, and an unreadable one
//                           REFUSES. KCTUtilities.SpendFunds performs NO
//                           affordability test of its own: its whole body is a
//                           Funding.Instance.AddFunds of the negative amount, so
//                           a handler that skipped this would drive a career into
//                           negative funds and RP-1 would never complain
//
// ProcessUntooledParts is the fifth and is not reproduced, because it cannot
// fire: its own condition is HighLogic.LoadedSceneIsEditor, and it is a reminder
// that charges nothing. ProcessExcessEC is a popup that offers to drain
// batteries, and it refuses nothing.
//
// WHERE THE CRAFT FILE COMES FROM, and why not from here. Opening one means
// ShipConstruction.GetShipsPathFor, ConfigNode.Load and ShipConstruct.LoadShip,
// the last of which INSTANTIATES a Unity part per PART node and leaves the
// GameObjects for somebody to destroy. This assembly holds no KSP or Unity
// reference at all, deliberately, and managing Unity object lifetime through
// MethodInfo.Invoke from an assembly that cannot name UnityEngine.Object is how a
// scene ends up with a craft standing at the world origin. So core does that
// half, behind the ICraftCatalogue capability, and hands back a handle this file
// never opens: it goes straight into RP-1's constructor and straight back to
// Release. That seam is the sanctioned one and is available to any Uplink,
// which matters because a first-party shortcut here would be a capability no
// third-party author could reach.
//
// WHAT IS READ, and why each is safe:
//
//   SpaceCenterManagement.Instance / .enabledForSave / .KSCs
//                                    the same three reads Rp1ScReflection opens
//                                    with, vouched for there
//   LCSpaceCenter.LaunchComplexes    [Persistent] list
//   LaunchComplex.ID/.Name/.IsOperational/.LCType
//                                    plain fields and one-line reads of _lcData
//   Funding.Instance.Funds           read ONLY to put a number beside a refusal
//
// WHAT IS INVOKED, each a write RP-1 itself performs on the same click:
//
//   new VesselProject(ShipConstruct, string, string, bool)
//                                    RP-1's ONLY constructor that measures a
//                                    craft: mass, size, cost, effective cost,
//                                    build points, part names, human rating and
//                                    stage counts all come off the live parts,
//                                    and the craft node is stored. There is no
//                                    node-only route to the same object, and
//                                    assembling one field by field would be this
//                                    Uplink guessing at RP-1's arithmetic
//   VesselProject.LCID = complex.ID  the same assignment RP-1's own overrideLC
//                                    argument makes, and the whole of how a
//                                    vehicle is built somewhere other than the
//                                    active complex
//   VesselProject.MeetsFacilityRequirements(List<string>)
//   VesselProject.GetTotalCost()
//   CurrencyModifierQueryRP0.RunQuery / .CanAfford / .GetTotal
//   KCTUtilities.AddVesselToBuildList(vp, spendFunds)
//
// PROVENANCE. Every member named above was read out of an ilspycmd disassembly of
// the INSTALLED RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll. The disassembly verifies SHAPE and never
// VALUE: nothing here has been exercised against a running game, so every hop is
