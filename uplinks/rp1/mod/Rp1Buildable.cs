// The buildable preview: every saved craft file measured against every launch
// complex, so a widget can offer a build control that is dark with its reason
// rather than one that can only refuse.
//
// PURE. Nothing here reads RP-1, KSP or Unity. The craft measurements arrive
// from core's craft catalogue (a capability, because opening a craft file
// instantiates Unity parts and an Uplink may not name a Unity type), the complex
// limits arrive from the space-centre walk, and this is the comparison between
// them, run through Rp1Envelope so the same arithmetic answers here and on the
// rollout channel.
//
// WHY THE PREVIEW IS DELIBERATELY MORE PERMISSIVE THAN THE COMMAND. Two arms of
// RP-1's MeetsFacilityRequirements cannot be answered from a craft file:
//
//   humanRated       RP-1 derives it from part tags, through its own effective-cost
//                    walk over the loaded parts. A craft file does not say.
//   ResourcesOK      compares the craft's resourceAmounts against the complex's
//                    resourcesHandled, and the exemption arm needs a KSP resource
//                    density lookup.
//
// Neither is applied, so a craft that would be refused for one of them shows as
// eligible here and is refused by rp1.build.start, which asks RP-1 itself. That
// direction is chosen rather than tolerated: this channel exists because a
// surface with no way to start a build is a dead end, and a control drawn dark
// for a reason nobody could establish is the same dead end with a label on it. A
// refusal an operator reads at the press, in RP-1's own words, is strictly better
// than a control they cannot press.
