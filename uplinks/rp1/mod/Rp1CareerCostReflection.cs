// What a build will cost in FUNDS, and what RP-1 has recorded as having happened.
// Same arm's-length reflection pattern as the rest of this Uplink.
//
// PROVENANCE. Every member below was read out of an ilspycmd disassembly of the
// SHIPPED RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll, and the two KSP members out of the shipped
// Assembly-CSharp.dll.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT RP-1's OWN "COST BREAKDOWN". Its CostBreakdownGUI shows
// `effectiveCost` and `ModifiedEC`, and effectiveCost is the argument to
// Formula.GetVesselBuildPoints: it decides how LONG integration takes. The
// producer's own tooltip calls it a metric for comparing rockets against each
// other. It is not funds, it buys nothing, and it is called cost. Publishing it as
// one would be the substituted-quantity failure in its purest form, so the funds
// figures are read from where they actually live instead -- four separate fields
// on SpaceCenterManagement and one on the vessel.
//
// THE SURCHARGE IS ALREADY INSIDE THE VEHICLE COST, and this is the trap on this
// path. ModuleTooling is an IPartCostModifier, the game persists its contribution
// onto each part node as `modCost`, and ShipConstruction.GetPartCostsAndMass adds
// that straight into the part's dry cost. So VesselProject.cost CONTAINS the
// untooled penalty before anything here sees it, and a breakdown listing the two
// as separate lines would charge the operator twice for one thing. The surcharge
// travels as an OF WHICH.
//
// MEMBERS DELIBERATELY NOT CALLED, and why:
//
//   VesselProject.GetTotalCost()
//       lazily FILLS `cost` and `emptyCost` from the compressed craft node and
//       then calls CompressAndRelease on it. A read that populates a cache and
//       releases a buffer is a write, and the plain `cost` field beside it is the
//       same number without the side effect. A zero there reads as absent, which
//       is the honest answer for a vessel nobody has priced yet.
//   ToolingGUI.GetUntooledPartsAndCost
//       prices by performing every purchase for real and reloading the database.
//       See Rp1ToolingReflection's header; the cached total is used instead.
//   CareerLog.CurrentPeriod and the period dictionary
//       the monthly financial ledger. Read by nothing here on purpose: it is a
//       balance sheet rather than a timeline, and it belongs on a budget surface
//       rather than on an event feed.
