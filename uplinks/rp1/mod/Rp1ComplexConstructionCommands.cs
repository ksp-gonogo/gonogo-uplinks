// The launch-complex acts that are QUEUED and COST FUNDS: build a complex, renovate
// one, add a pad to one.
//
// WHY THESE THREE ARE APART FROM THE OTHER FOUR. Renaming and demolishing write
// RP-1's own state and take effect at once; there is no figure to get wrong. These
// three put a project on RP-1's construction queue with a PRICE on it, and RP-1
// then draws that price down out of the career's funds as the project progresses.
// A wrong figure here does not throw and does not refuse: it is simply charged.
// The arithmetic lives in Rp1LcCostModel, apart again, with its own provenance
// block and its own pinned suite, because it is the only part of this Uplink that
// is neither an RP-1 call nor a plain read.
//
// WHAT NONE OF THEM DOES: spend anything at the moment it lands. Under RP-1 a
// construction is not a purchase. The project is added to a queue and the funds are
// drawn as it builds, at a rate that FALLS when the career is short, so a complex
// cannot overdraw a career and an up-front affordability check here would refuse
// work RP-1 itself would happily start and simply run slowly. That is the same
// reasoning Rp1FacilityUpgradeCommands' header gives for a facility, and the same
// conclusion: never refuse on affordability, because RP-1 does not.
//
// A NEW COMPLEX IS ALWAYS A PAD. RP-1's own new-complex path assigns
// `lcType = LaunchComplexType.Pad` unconditionally (KCT_GUI:561), and the single
// Hangar a career has is seeded at career start from LCData.StartingHangar. So
// there is no type argument: offering one would offer a choice the game does not
// have and a value whose consequences RP-1's own code paths do not expect.
//
// THE HANGAR IS A DIFFERENT SHAPE OF RENOVATION, not a special case bolted on. It
// has no pad, no tonnage limit and no human-rating toggle: RP-1 forces
// isHumanRated true for it, holds massMax at whatever it already was, and does not
// draw either field. So a modify naming the hangar REFUSES a tonnage or a rating
// rather than discarding it, because a discarded argument is a command that
// reported success for something it did not do.
//
// WHAT IS INVOKED, each of them a write RP-1 itself performs on the same click:
//
//   new LaunchComplex(LCData, LCSpaceCenter)
//                                    ARITY TWO. It copies the specification rather
//                                    than holding ours, registers the complex with
//                                    RP-1's scenario module and hooks its lists
//   new LCLaunchPad(Guid, string, float)
//                                    ARITY THREE, and isOperational starts FALSE:
//                                    a pad is under construction until its project
//                                    completes
//   KCTUtilities.ChangeEngineers(LaunchComplex, -Engineers)
//                                    what takes the complex's whole crew off, which
//                                    RP-1 does FIRST and tells the operator about
//                                    in a dialog. Resolved by first-parameter TYPE
//                                    through Rp1ComplexWrites, because the
//                                    LCSpaceCenter overload has the same arity and
//                                    moving a centre's pool instead would be silent
//   LCSpaceCenter.SwitchToPrevLaunchComplex(bool)
//                                    ARITY ONE: the parameter is optional in C# and
//                                    reflection applies no defaults
//   LaunchComplex.RecalculateBuildRates()
//                                    without it the complex keeps quoting the rate
//                                    it had before it went out of service
//   ConstructionProject.SetBP(double, double)
//                                    the price turned into a build duration, by
//                                    RP-1's own curve. INVOKED rather than
//                                    reimplemented, which is why Formula's
//                                    construction curve is absent from the cost model
//   LCData.SetFrom(LCData)           the COPY a project holds. A project keeping the
//                                    caller's object would change under it
//   PersistentObservableList.Add     on LCConstructions and PadConstructions, and it
//                                    must be the MOST-DERIVED Add: it shadows
//                                    List<T>.Add and fires the events RP-1's own UI
//                                    listens on, so binding to the base overload
//                                    queues the project and tells nobody. RP-1's IL
//                                    calls the derived one on both of these and the
//                                    BASE one on LaunchComplexes and LaunchPads,
//                                    which are plain PersistentList; each is matched
//                                    to whichever RP-1 uses
//   SCMEvents.OnLCConstructionQueued / OnPadConstructionQueued
//                                    fired last and inside their own try, as RP-1
//                                    does: a subscriber that throws must not make a
//                                    queued project report failure
//
// FIELDS WRITTEN DIRECTLY, because no RP-1 method sets them:
//   LaunchComplex.IsOperational      false for the whole of a construction
//   SpaceCenterManagement.StarterLCBuilding
//                                    RP-1's first-run flag, `|= !isModify`. It gates
//                                    RP-1's own start-up guidance, and a career
//                                    whose first complex was ordered from here would
//                                    otherwise still be told to order one
//   LCConstructionProject.lcID / cost / name / isModify / modId / lcData /
//   engineersToReadd, PadConstructionProject.id / cost / name
//                                    the project itself, which RP-1 builds with an
//                                    object initialiser and no constructor
//
// THE CAREER BRANCH IS MIRRORED, not assumed. RP-1 branches on
// ROUtils.KSPUtils.CurrentGameIsCareer(): outside a career it applies the change at
// once and queues nothing, because there is no funding to draw against. Note
// `enabledForSave` is TRUE for sandbox and science-sandbox too, so this is a real
// branch rather than a formality, and it is REFUSED rather than guessed when the
// method will not resolve: queueing a funded project on a save with no funding
// would leave it stalled forever with nothing saying why.
//
// PROVENANCE. Every member named above was read out of an ilspycmd disassembly of
// the INSTALLED RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll; the write ORDER is KCT_GUI.ProcessNewLC's,
// and the list-Add resolution was checked against that method's IL rather than its
// decompilation. The disassembly verifies SHAPE and never VALUE: nothing here has
// been exercised against a running game, so every hop is null-safe and every
// failure to read refuses the command rather than guessing at it. The PRICE
// specifically has never been compared against RP-1's own displayed figure, which
// is the one live check this surface most wants (see Rp1LcCostModel's provenance).
