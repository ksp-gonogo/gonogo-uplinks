// The launch-complex acts that are IMMEDIATE and cost nothing: rename a complex,
// demolish one, and rename or demolish one of its pads.
//
// WHY THESE FOUR ARE TOGETHER AND THE OTHER THREE ARE NOT. Building a complex,
// renovating one and adding a pad all go on RP-1's construction queue and all
// three need a PRICE, which RP-1 computes nowhere reusable (see
// Rp1LcCostModel's header for what that costs us). These four write RP-1's own
// state directly, take effect the moment they land, and there is no figure to get
// wrong. Keeping them apart means the half of the surface with no arithmetic in it
// can be trusted on its own terms.
//
// WHAT WAS STILL WRONG. An operator could read a complex's whole state, rush it
// and staff it, and could not correct its name, could not remove a pad they had
// added by mistake, and could not close a complex they had outgrown. Every one of
// those is a press in RP-1's own window.
//
// TWO OF RP-1's OWN CONTROLS DO NOTHING AND SAY NOTHING, and converting both is
// most of why this file is worth having:
//
//   A PAD DISMANTLE WITH ONE PAD LEFT. RP-1's check is
//   `LaunchPadCount >= 2 && !ActiveLPInstance.Delete(out reason)`, so with one
//   operational pad the && short-circuits: the confirmation dialog has already
//   asked "This cannot be undone!", the operator presses Yes, the window closes,
//   and the pad is still there. Nothing is posted anywhere.
//
//   A PAD RENAME TO A NAME ALREADY IN USE. LCLaunchPad.Rename returns without
//   doing anything when another pad at the complex has that name, and the rename
//   window that called it reports nothing. Same shape: Save closes the window and
//   the old name is still there.
//
// A confirmation that does nothing is worse than a refusal, because the operator
// believes it worked. Both are refusals here.
//
// WHAT DISMANTLING AN LC ACTUALLY DESTROYS, which is not what the game's dialog
// implies and not what our own spec said either:
//
//   NOT A VESSEL. RP-1 refuses the dismantle while the complex holds anything:
//   CanDismantle requires an empty build list AND an empty warehouse. Verified in
//   IL rather than only in a decompiler, because it inverts a finding we were
//   working from: LaunchComplex::get_CanModifyButton IL_000e-IL_0018 loads
//   Warehouse, takes its Count and `brtrue.s` to `ldc.i4.0`, and
//   KCT_GUI::TryDismantlePadOrLC gates on it at IL_0031 while its
//   KCTUtilities::ScrapVessel call sits at IL_0176. That loop over the warehouse
//   is DEAD CODE, and ScrapVessel refunds in full anyway.
//
//   THE COMPLEX'S EARNED BUILD EFFICIENCY. This is the real loss and the game
//   names it nowhere. LaunchComplex.Delete calls LCEfficiency.RemoveLC, which
//   calls ClearEmpty() when the complex was the last member of its efficiency
//   group. A complex rebuilt to the same specification starts again from RP-1's
//   floor. Whether it is lost or survives depends entirely on whether another
//   complex shares the group, so this command reports WHICH of the two happened
//   and a client can warn with the right one of two quite different sentences
//   before the press: rp1.complexes[].efficiency is the figure at risk and
//   rp1.complexes[].efficiencySharedWith says whether a sibling keeps it.
//
//   ITS PADS, and nothing else. The engineers come back by themselves: a centre's
//   unassigned pool is DERIVED as its headcount minus what its complexes hold, so
//   removing a complex frees its crew without anything writing them anywhere.
//
// WHAT IS INVOKED, each of them the write RP-1 performs on the same click:
//
//   LaunchComplex.Rename(string)      assigns the name on the complex and on its
//                                     persisted stats. Validates NOTHING, which is
//                                     why the duplicate check here is ours
//   LCLaunchPad.Rename(string)        rewrites the name on the pad AND on every
//                                     rollout and pending construction stored
//                                     against it, which is what makes the rename
//                                     RP-1's to perform rather than a field to write
//   LCLaunchPad.Delete(out string)    removes the pad, walks every centre to find
//                                     which complex holds it, and shifts the
//                                     launchSiteIndex of every vessel that pointed
//                                     past it. Its out-reason is carried into the
//                                     refusal verbatim
//   LCSpaceCenter.SwitchToPrevLaunchComplex(bool)
//                                     ARITY ONE, not zero: the parameter is
//                                     optional in C# and reflection applies no
//                                     defaults, so false is passed explicitly
//   LaunchComplex.Delete()            unregisters the complex and its pads, drops
//                                     its efficiency contribution, clears a staff
//                                     target that named it, and removes it from its
//                                     centre
//   SCMEvents.OnLCDismantled / OnPadDismantled
//                                     fired last, and inside their own try, exactly
//                                     as RP-1 does: a subscriber that throws must
//                                     not make a completed dismantle report failure
//
// ONE DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE, and it is safer rather than different: where RP-1
// would scrap a non-empty warehouse this REFUSES. The scrap path is unreachable
// (see above), so the case cannot arise from RP-1's own reasoning; but
// CanDismantle is one bool over four conditions and if it ever read true with
// vessels present, destroying them silently is the one outcome nobody could want.
//
// PROVENANCE. Every member named above was read out of an ilspycmd disassembly of
// the INSTALLED RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll, and the dismantle gate additionally out of
// its IL. The disassembly verifies SHAPE and never VALUE: nothing here has been
// exercised against a running game, so every hop is null-safe and every failure to
// read refuses the command rather than guessing at it.
