// The payload mass RP-1's repeating satellite contracts require, set once instead
// of ninety-six times.
//
// WHAT RP-1 DOES, and it is the reason this command exists rather than a slider.
// ContractGUI.RenderContractsTab draws two sliders and runs EVERY DRAW FRAME. Each
// frame it reads the slider back, compares it against the stored setting, fires the
// withdrawal for every matching contract name, and only THEN writes the setting.
// So the comparison is against the PREVIOUS frame's value, and a drag from 400 to
// 10,000 crosses ninety-six hundred-unit steps and fires the withdrawal at every
// one of them. Nothing on the tab says so.
//
// WHAT THE WITHDRAWAL ACTUALLY REACHES, stated precisely because the frightening
// version is wrong and an operator deserves the true one. WithdrawContractAction is
// a static Func<string, bool> on ContractGUI that RP0.dll only ever READS: it is
// assigned by CC_RP0.dll, in
// ContractConfigurator.RP0.CustomExpressionParserRegistrer.RegisterRP0Hooks, and
// its implementation walks ContractPreLoader.Instance.PendingContracts() and
// withdraws the FIRST match, then returns. So it reaches PRE-GENERATED OFFERS and
// never an accepted contract, and it takes one per name per call. A drag churns the
// offer pool so offers regenerate against the new requirement, which is the intent
// of the feature fired far too often. It is WASTE, not loss.
//
// THE STATE RP-1 CANNOT TELL THE PLAYER, and the most valuable thing this command
// returns. On an install without CC_RP0 the delegate is NULL, RP-1's `?.Invoke`
// does nothing, and the payload requirement changes while every pending offer keeps
// the OLD one. RP-1's tab reports that exactly as it reports success: silently. This
// command says whether the hook was there and how many offers actually went.
//
// WHAT IS READ RATHER THAN WRITTEN DOWN. The bounds and the contract names are
// RP-1's own:
//
//   ContractGUI.MinPayload / MaxPayload
//                              the range its sliders span. Read rather than
//                              hard-coded so a retune moves our refusal with it
//   ContractGUI._comSatContracts / _weatherSatContracts
//                              PRIVATE static string arrays naming which contract
//                              types each figure invalidates: three comsat types
//                              and one weather. Read rather than copied, so an
//                              RP-1 release that adds a fourth comsat type has its
//                              offers withdrawn too without this file being told
//
// WHAT IS WRITTEN, and it is TWO places for one value:
//
//   ContractGUI.CommsPayload / WeatherPayload
//                              the live statics, which is what
//                              ContractConfigurator's RP1CommsPayload expression
//                              function reads when it generates a contract
//   RP0Settings.CommsPayload / WeatherPayload
//                              the PERSISTED halves, reached through KSP's
//                              GameParameters. Writing only the statics would let
//                              the figure revert on load; writing only the settings
//                              would leave the next generated contract on the old
//                              requirement. RP-1 writes both and so must this
//
// KSP's SETTINGS ACCESSOR HAS TWO OVERLOADS AND ONLY ONE IS SAFE.
// GameParameters declares `T CustomParams<T>()` (generic, arity 0) beside
// `CustomParameterNode CustomParams(Type)` (arity 1). This uses the NON-GENERIC
// one, matched on its first parameter's type, for two reasons: reflection would
// need MakeGenericMethod for the other, and the generic one THROWS an
// ArgumentException when the node is not registered where the non-generic returns.
// A refusal beats an exception crossing the Uplink boundary.
//
// The decompilation of both is obfuscator-mangled (unreachable switch arms,
// `if (1 == 0)`, LdMemberToken artefacts), so NOTHING here relies on their bodies:
// only on the signatures, which are not obfuscated, and on treating a null return
// as "not registered". That is the discipline this repo already learned the hard
// way about reading KSP's own assembly.
//
// PROVENANCE. RP-1's members were read out of an ilspycmd disassembly of the
// INSTALLED RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll; the withdrawal's implementation out of the
// INSTALLED CC_RP0.dll beside it; and KSP's accessor signatures out of the
// installed Assembly-CSharp.dll. Shape is verified and value is not: nothing here
// has been exercised against a running game, so every hop is null-safe and every
// failure to read refuses the command rather than guessing at it.
