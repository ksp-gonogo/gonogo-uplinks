// RP-1's crew bookkeeping, read by reflection. No compile-time reference to
// RP0.dll, same arm's-length pattern as Rp1ScReflection, whose header carries the
// provenance rules this file follows.
//
// PROVENANCE. Every member below was read out of an ilspycmd disassembly of the
// SHIPPED RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll at GameData/RP-1/Plugins/RP0.dll.
// RP0.Crew.CrewHandler is a ScenarioModule, so its Instance is live only inside a
// save RP-1 manages.
//
// WHY THE PRIVATE FIELDS RATHER THAN THE PUBLIC GETTERS. CrewHandler exposes
// IsRetired(pcm), GetRetireTime(name), GetRetireIncreaseTime(name) and
// GetTrainingFinishTime(pcm), and three of the four are read here as the private
// collections behind them instead:
//
//   _retirees       IsRetired is `_retirees.Contains(pcm.name)`. The set is read
//                   ONCE per tick and every kerbal answered from it, rather than
//                   one reflected invoke per kerbal per tick. It also needs no
//                   ProtoCrewMember, so this file stays KSP-free.
//   _retireTimes    GetRetireTime is a TryGetValue that returns 0.0 on a miss, so
//                   the getter cannot distinguish "no record" from "retires at UT
//                   zero". Reading the dictionary keeps the distinction.
//   _retireIncreases  same shape, same reason.
//   _expireTimes    has no public getter at all: GetExpiration is private and
//                   GetTrainingString formats it into prose.
//
// TrainingCourses is public and is read as itself.
//
// MEMBERS DELIBERATELY NOT CALLED, and why:
//
//   CrewHandler.GetTrainingFinishTime, TrainingCourse.GetTimeLeft /
//   .GetBuildRate / .CalculateBuildRate
//       the chain ends in CurrencyUtils.Rate, whose body FIRES
//       GameEvents.Modifiers.OnCurrencyModifierQuery at every modifier in the
//       save. The same fence Rp1EconomyBackend and Rp1ProgramsReflection stand
//       behind. The rate is read off TrainingCourse._buildRate, the cache those
//       getters populate, and an unrated course reports an absent date.
//   TrainingCourse.GetFractionComplete
//       pure, but a one-line divide, and RP-1 leaves it a NaN on a zero-point
//       course. Reproduced in Rp1CrewMath so the NaN becomes absent.
//   CrewHandler.GetTrainingString, GetPrettyCourseName
//       build display prose with embedded dates. A dashboard formats its own
//       dates from a UT; prose on the wire is a date nothing can convert.
//   CrewHandler.IncreaseRetireTime, AddExpiration, RemoveExpiration
//       writers. A telemetry read must not move a player's retirement date.
//   CrewHandler.RnRProjects
//       a property whose getter REBUILDS a list on a dirty flag, so reading it
//       from a capture is a write. It carries nothing new either: an R&R project
//       is a wrapper over ProtoCrewMember.inactive / inactiveTimeEnd, which are
//       STOCK fields and now ride the stock roster entry.
