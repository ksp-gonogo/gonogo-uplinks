// Reflection-only, same arm's-length treatment as Rp1ScReflection: no
// compile-time reference to RP0.dll, every member reached by name at runtime,
// null-safe per hop.
//
// PROVENANCE. Every member below was read out of an ilspycmd disassembly of the
// INSTALLED GameData/RP-1/Plugins/RP0.dll on 2026-08-27, and the sequence the
// fix depends on came out of the same disassembly:
//
//   RP0.Harmony.PatchRnD.Prefix_AddScience replaces ResearchAndDevelopment
//   .AddScience outright, and fires, in this order:
//       GameEvents.Modifiers.OnCurrencyModifierQuery
//       GameEvents.Modifiers.OnCurrencyModified      <- RP-1 banks its award here
//       GameEvents.OnScienceChanged                  <- the interceptor neutralises here
//
//   RP0.Confidence.OnCurrenciesModified is on the middle one. It prices an award
//   whenever the query's SCIENCE input is positive and the reason is 1024, 32 or
//   0 (ScienceTransmission, VesselRecovery, None), banks it into a PRIVATE
//   double, fires Confidence.OnConfidenceChanged, and ratchets a second private
//   double confidenceEarned on a positive delta only.
//
//   RP0.KCTUtilities.ProcessSciPointTotalChange moves
//   SpaceCenterManagement.SciPointsTotal off the same event with NO reason
//   filter at all. That total is the curve input the confidence award is priced
//   from, so it is the second derived quantity, not a separate concern.
//
// The interceptor's neutralise is ResearchAndDevelopment.SetScience, and neither
// stock nor RP-1 fires any currency event from SetScience/SetFunds/
// SetReputation. So RP-1 is never told to revisit what it derived, and this arm
// is what tells it.
