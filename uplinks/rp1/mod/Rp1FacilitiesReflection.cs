// The space centre's buildings, read the way RP-1 reads them rather than the way
// KSP's scene does, so the answer survives leaving the space centre.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Core fills career.status.facilities from
// ScenarioUpgradeableFacilities.protoUpgradeables[id].facilityRefs, and that
// list is populated by UpgradeableFacility MonoBehaviours which KSP instantiates
// in the SPACECENTER scene only. So in the editor, in flight and in the tracking
// station every tier and every price on that payload arrives absent. The
// standing sentence about it -- that the buildings are not in the scene, so
// their tiers cannot be read from here -- is true of THAT path and is not true
// of the game.
//
// RP-1 READS THEM OFF-SCENE ITSELF, EVERY TICK, and that is the fact this file
// is built on rather than an inference from one:
//
//   MaintenanceHandler.UpdateUpkeep() walks FacilitiesForMaintenance and calls
//   KCTUtilities.GetFacilityLevel(facility) for each, to bill the career for
//   what it owns. MaintenanceHandler carries
//   [KSPScenario(..., EDITOR, FLIGHT, SPACECENTER, TRACKSTATION)] -- read out of
//   the IL rather than the decompiled attribute, whose arguments ilspycmd cannot
//   render -- so that walk runs in all four scenes.
//
// THE TWO READS THAT MAKE IT WORK, both off the shipped RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll:
//
//   KCTUtilities.GetFacilityLevel(SpaceCenterFacility)
//       => MathUtils.GetIndexFromNorm(
//              ScenarioUpgradeableFacilities.GetFacilityLevel(facility),
//              Database.GetFacilityLevelCount(facility))
//
//     The first argument is the NORMALISED level KSP persists in the save.
//     ProtoUpgradeable.GetLevel() returns facilityRefs[0].GetNormLevel() when the
//     scene has instantiated the building and PARSES configNode's "lvl" when it
//     has not, which is the branch that answers off-scene. The operator's own
//     save carries it: a SCENARIO named ScenarioUpgradeableFacilities, marked
//     `scene = 5, 6, 7, 8`, holding one `lvl` per building.
//
//   Database.FacilityLevelCosts : Dictionary<SpaceCenterFacility, List<int>>
//
//     RP-1's own copy of the CustomBarnKit `upgrades` list, parsed at load time
//     in Database.<LoadFacilityData> and never touched again. Its Count is the
//     number of tiers and entry [n] is what tier n costs, so the price of the
//     next step is [tier + 1]. Both were checked against the shipped
//     RP-1/CustomBarnKit.cfg and against a live reading of the running career:
//     ADMINISTRATION declares `levels = 9` and
//     `upgrades = 25000, 40000, 140000, ...`, and the space centre showed
//     "Administration tier 0 of 8, upgrade 40,000f" -- Count-1 and entry [1].
//
// WHAT IS STILL SCENE-BOUND, and is therefore not here. The tier DESCRIPTIONS
// (GetLevelText / GetNextLevelText) come off the live facility and have no
// config mirror, so they stay on career.status where they can only be read at
// the space centre. This channel carries three facts, not four.
//
// NOTHING IS INVOKED THAT WRITES. GetFacilityLevel's whole effect is its return
// value; the two static string dictionaries it memoises into
// (ScenarioUpgradeableFacilities.facilityStrings and .slashSanitizedStrings) are
// transient lookup caches, not save state, and RP-1's own upkeep pass fills them
// on the same tick anyway.
