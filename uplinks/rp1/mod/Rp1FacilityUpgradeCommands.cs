// The RP-1-native facility upgrade: the command Rp1CareerProjectGate refuses
// career.facility.upgrade in favour of, and which until now did not exist.
//
// WHAT THE GATE SAYS AND WHY THIS ANSWERS IT. Core's career.facility.upgrade
// calls UpgradeableFacility.SetLevel and pays the stock price, which under RP-1
// jumps a tier instantly next to a construction queue that never heard of it.
// The gate refuses that, and its header sets out why it refuses rather than
// quietly enqueuing: enqueuing is a DIFFERENT ACT, at a different price, with a
// completion weeks away and a queue position that depends on how many engineers
// the centre has. That act belongs to a command of its own in this Uplink's own
// namespace, and this is it.
//
// WHAT IT REPRODUCES, AND WHY IT HAS TO. RP-1 performs the enqueue in
// RP0.Harmony.PatchKSCFacilityContextMenu.ProcessUpgrade, which is private
// static on a Harmony patch class and cannot be called. Every step it takes is
// independently reachable, so the procedure is reproduced call for call and in
// RP-1's own order:
//
//   1. the tech gate, which is RP-1's own rule and is read below rather than
//      reproduced
//   2. FacilityUpgradeProject.AlreadyInProgressByID(id), RP-1's own guard
//   3. new FacilityUpgradeProject(type, id, newLevel, oldLevel, name)
//   4. proj.SetBP(upgradeCost, cumulativeLevelCost), which is what turns a price
//      into a build duration
//   5. proj.cost = upgradeCost
//   6. SpaceCenterManagement.Instance.ActiveSC.FacilityUpgrades.Add(proj)
//   7. SCMEvents.OnFacilityUpgradeQueued.Fire(proj), inside a try/catch, exactly
//      as RP-1 wraps its own fire
//
// The one step RP-1's own code takes that this does not is the on-screen
// message, which has no operator on this side of the link to read it.
//
// NOTHING IS CHARGED HERE, and that is the design fact that shapes the whole
// command. ProcessUpgrade spends no funds at all: ConstructionProject.AddProgress
// draws them down incrementally as the project progresses, and it throttles
// itself to what the career can afford at the time (GetAffordableFundsFraction).
// So there is NO affordability refusal, and adding one would invent a rule RP-1
// does not have and refuse something the game permits. Rp1BuildCommands' "the
// money check cannot be skipped" lesson does not transfer: there the spend was
// immediate and unguarded, here RP-1 guards it continuously.
//
// THE HOUSE RULE IS STILL OBEYED. Queueing this commits the career to a drain,
// so the price and the balance travel together. BEFORE the press they are
// already on the wire, on core's career.status: facilities[<name>].upgradeCost
// is the identical UpgradeableFacility.GetUpgradeCost() call ProcessUpgrade
// makes, and economy.funds sits beside it in the same payload (confirmed on the
// live Deck stream, 2026-08-30). AFTER it, the result payload carries both again
// so the confirmation an operator reads names what was committed and what is
// left, without a second round trip.
//
// THE SCENE CONSTRAINT WAS NOT REAL, and the claim that it was is retracted here.
// What is true is narrower: the live UpgradeableFacility MonoBehaviours exist in
// the SPACECENTER scene only, so protoUpgradeables[id].facilityRefs is empty
// everywhere else (protoUpgradeables ITSELF is four-scene, rebuilt from the save
// in OnLoad, which is why the dictionary answers and the list inside it does not).
// That was measured, on the running Deck install on 2026-08-30: with
// spaceCenter.scene = "Flight", every entry of career.status.facilities reported
// currentTier, maxTier and upgradeCost as null.
//
// The step that did not follow is that ENQUEUEING needs one. It does not. Every
// figure ProcessUpgrade takes off the live building has a config- or save-backed
// twin that RP-1 itself reads, and reads OFF-SCENE, on its own hot paths:
//
//   FacilityLevel        -> KCTUtilities.GetFacilityLevel(SpaceCenterFacility),
//                           which denormalises ProtoUpgradeable.GetLevel()'s
//                           configNode "lvl" fallback against Database's tier
//                           count. FacilityUpgradeProject.Apply() uses THIS, not
//                           the live level, to verify its own completion
//   MaxLevel             -> Database.GetFacilityLevelCount(f) - 1, which is the
//                           same expression KCTUtilities.SetFacilityLevel uses in
//                           its own no-live-facility fallback arm
//   GetUpgradeCost()     -> Database.FacilityLevelCosts[f][level + 1], times the
//                           career's FundsLossMultiplier under the identical
//                           LoadedSceneIsGame condition. GetUpgradeCost's whole
//                           body is upgradeLevels[facilityLevel + 1].levelCost
//                           scaled by that multiplier
//   sum of levelCost[0..level]
//                        -> MathUtils.SumThrough(Database.FacilityLevelCosts[f],
//                           level), which is ProcessUpgrade's descending loop
//                           term for term. MaintenanceHandler.UpdateUpkeep bills
//                           the career off exactly this expression in EDITOR,
//                           FLIGHT, SPACECENTER and TRACKSTATION
//   IsUpgradeable(facility)
//                        -> its body is a case-insensitive IndexOf of each
//                           Database.LockedFacilities name in facility.id. The id
//                           is the only thing it reads off the MonoBehaviour, and
//                           this command starts from the id
//
// And RP-1 does the substitution itself, in its own code, with no live facility
// in reach: v3_0_KCTAdminUpgrade.OnUpgrade builds a FacilityUpgradeProject's cost
// and oldCost out of Database.FacilityLevelCosts and MathUtils.SumThrough during
// SAVE MIGRATION, before any scene has been loaded at all.
//
// NOTHING ELSE ON THE PATH IS SCENE-BOUND either, checked call by call against
// the shipped RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll:
//
//   Formula.GetConstructionBP(cost, oldCost, type) is sqrt(cost + oldCost) -
//     sqrt(oldCost), floored at 3. It does not read its own facilityType argument
//   ConstructionProject.SetBP is one line, that formula and nothing else
//   FacilityUpgradeProject's five-argument constructor assigns five fields
//   AlreadyInProgressByID walks SpaceCenterManagement.Instance.KSCs
//   GetTechGate reads a dictionary built from GameDatabase's KCTBUILDINGTECHS
//   LCSpaceCenter.RecalculateBuildRates walks the centre's own lists
//   SpaceCenterManagement carries [KSPScenario(..., EDITOR, FLIGHT, SPACECENTER,
//     TRACKSTATION)], read out of the IL blob (04 00 00 00 | 06 07 05 08) because
//     ilspycmd renders that attribute's arguments as "could not decode"
//
// The project COMPLETES off-scene too, which is the fact that settles it:
// ProcessComplete guards on ScenarioUpgradeableFacilities.Instance, itself a
// four-scene KSPScenario, and Apply() goes through KCTUtilities.SetFacilityLevel,
// whose second arm writes configNode "lvl" directly when facilityRefs is empty.
// RP-1 finishes a facility upgrade in flight by design. Refusing to START one
// there was our rule, not the game's.
//
// SO THE COMMAND PRICES FROM WHICHEVER SOURCE IT HAS. The live facility first,
// wherever it exists, because that is literal parity with the button RP-1 draws
// at the space centre and it is the path already confirmed on the rig; RP-1's own
// config table otherwise. The gate asks whether EITHER answers, and the refusal
// names that condition rather than a scene.
//
// LOCKED FACILITIES: FIVE OF THE NINE ARE NOT UPGRADED BY RP-1 AT ALL, and this
// was the refusal the design arrived without. It was found on the rig rather
// than in the disassembly, because it is a fact about RP-1's CONFIG and not
// about its code.
//
//   Read off the running Deck career on 2026-08-30, at the space centre:
//
//     Administration    tier 0 of 8   upgrade  40,000f
//     AstronautComplex  tier 0 of 4   upgrade  30,000f
//     MissionControl    tier 0 of 4   upgrade  60,000f
//     TrackingStation   tier 0 of 10  upgrade  50,000f
//     LaunchPad         tier 0 of 2   upgrade       1f
//     Runway            tier 0 of 2   upgrade       1f
//     VehicleAssemblyBuilding, SpaceplaneHangar, ResearchAndDevelopment
//                       tier 0 of 2   upgrade       1f
//
//   The five costing a single fund are the ones RP-1's CustomBarnKit.cfg gives
//   `upgrades = 1, 1, 1`, under its own comment "Cosmetic only - level set by
//   code to match other buildings". RP-1 loads exactly that value into
//   Database.LockedFacilities, and FacilityUpgradeProject.UpgradeLockedFacilities
//   then DRIVES their level from the mean of the ones it does upgrade, after
//   every real upgrade completes. Under RP-1 the capacity those five used to buy
//   is bought elsewhere entirely: a launch complex, or the research queue.
//
// So a project queued against one of them would cost nothing, finish almost at
// once, and then have the level it set overwritten by RP-1's own averaging. That
// is the same "state RP-1's own model has no way to produce" that
// Rp1CareerProjectGate exists to keep the stock command out of, arriving through
// this command's door instead. RP-1's own menu never offers it: its patch tests
// IsUpgradeable(facility) and disables the button. This command asks the SAME
// private predicate, and refuses.
//
// THREE TRAPS ON THIS PATH, none of which is about where the operator is standing:
//
//   1. GetFacilityType(SpaceCenterBuilding) is also private static, and
//      reflecting it does not help: it takes the clickable scene MonoBehaviour
//      and this command starts from an id string, so it is not callable on these
//      inputs. The SpaceCenterFacility is parsed from the id's last segment
//      instead, which is the same segment ProcessUpgrade passes as the project's
//      display name. A FAILED MATCH REFUSES and never defaults: for a modded or
//      KSCSwitcher site the last segment need not be an enum name, and the
//      absence of an answer is not VehicleAssemblyBuilding, which is what
//      ProcessUpgrade's own fall-through would make it. Defaulting there would
//      queue an upgrade against the WRONG BUILDING. The segment is matched
//      against Enum.GetNames rather than handed to Enum.Parse, because Parse
//      ALSO accepts an ordinal and a comma-separated flags list: an id ending in
//      "2" would come back as LaunchPad from a segment naming no building at
//      all, which is the same bug in a second costume.
//   2. FacilityUpgradeProject.GetFacilityReferencesById is a BARE INDEXER over
//      protoUpgradeables and throws KeyNotFoundException on a missing key, where
//      every other read on this path returns null or an empty list. It is
//      therefore not called at all: the dictionary is read with a guarded
//      TryGetValue here.
//   3. It does not sanitize the id and its sibling does.
//      ScenarioUpgradeableFacilities.GetFacilityLevel calls SlashSanitize first
//      and then TryGetValue; GetFacilityReferencesById does neither. So an id
//      that works perfectly with one throws in the other, and the asymmetry
//      passes every headless test and fires once, on the rig, on the one facility
//      whose id has a slash. The id is sanitized ONCE here, up front, and the
//      sanitized form is what reaches the project, the in-progress check and the
//      dictionary, so nothing downstream can disagree about which id this is.
//
// THE MEMBERS IT TOUCHES. RP-1's, each read off the shipped RP-1 v4.6.0.0
// RP0.dll:
//
//   PatchKSCFacilityContextMenu.GetTechGate(string, int)
//                                    PRIVATE static, one of the two non-public
//                                    members on this path, REFLECTED rather than
//                                    reproduced: its body is a lookup into a
//                                    dictionary RP-1 builds from its own
//                                    KCTBUILDINGTECHS config, so reproducing it
//                                    means re-parsing config this Uplink does not
//                                    own. It is a pure function and CheckLoadDict
//                                    self-initialises, so it is safe to call
//                                    cold. It is also the most fragile pin here,
//                                    a Harmony patch class being implementation
//                                    detail rather than API, which is why an
//                                    unreadable gate REFUSES
//   PatchKSCFacilityContextMenu.IsUpgradeable(UpgradeableFacility)
//                                    the other one, and the same bargain: its
//                                    answer comes out of Database.LockedFacilities
//                                    (RP-1's config again) and it matches by
//                                    case-insensitive SUBSTRING of the id rather
//                                    than by the enum. Unlike GetFacilityType
//                                    beside it, this one IS callable on our
//                                    inputs: it takes the UpgradeableFacility
//                                    this command already holds
//   FacilityUpgradeProject(SpaceCenterFacility, string, int, int, string)
//                                    public 5-arg ctor
//   FacilityUpgradeProject.AlreadyInProgressByID(string)
//                                    public static, and it searches EVERY centre
//                                    rather than the active one. It must: a
//                                    per-centre check would let a second queue
//                                    entry appear for a facility already being
//                                    upgraded at another KSC under KSCSwitcher
//   ConstructionProject.SetBP(double, double)
//                                    public, and the whole of how a price becomes
//                                    a duration (Formula.GetConstructionBP)
//   ConstructionProject.cost         public double field, written after SetBP
//                                    reads it, in RP-1's own order
//   SpaceCenterManagement.Instance.ActiveSC.FacilityUpgrades
//                                    public, already read by Rp1ScReflection. The
//                                    Add is what makes the project real: the list
//                                    is a PersistentObservableList whose Added
//                                    handler puts the project into the centre's
//                                    Constructions list and recalculates every
//                                    build rate, so the queue's own rate and ETA
//                                    are RP-1's from the next tick onward and
//                                    nothing here has to compute them
//   SCMEvents.OnFacilityUpgradeQueued
//                                    public static EventData, fired inside a
//                                    try/catch because RP-1 fires its own that way
//   Database.FacilityLevelCosts      the off-scene price table, entry [n] being
//                                    tier n's cost and the Count being the tier
//                                    count. Already read by Rp1FacilitiesReflection,
//                                    which is what puts these tiers on rp1.facilities
//   Database.LockedFacilities        the off-scene twin of IsUpgradeable's own
//                                    source, matched the way IsUpgradeable matches:
//                                    case-insensitive IndexOf against the facility id
//   KCTUtilities.GetFacilityLevel(SpaceCenterFacility)
//                                    the off-scene tier, invoked rather than
//                                    reproduced so the 0.01 epsilon in
//                                    GetIndexFromNorm stays RP-1's
//
// And KSP's, none of which is RP-1's to guard:
//
//   ScenarioUpgradeableFacilities.SlashSanitize / .protoUpgradeables
//   UpgradeableFacility.FacilityLevel / .MaxLevel / .UpgradeLevels / .GetUpgradeCost()
//   UpgradeableObject.UpgradeLevel.levelCost
//   HighLogic.LoadedSceneIsGame / .CurrentGame.Parameters.Career.FundsLossMultiplier
//   ResearchAndDevelopment.GetTechnologyState(string)
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT CALLED. ConstructionProject.GetTimeLeft() and
// GetBuildRate(), for the reason Rp1ScReflection's own header gives for going
// round them: GetBuildRate writes its own _buildRate and memoises a centre
// reference found by walking the roster, and GetTimeLeft answers an infinity on a
// project RP-1 has not costed yet. The estimate an operator wants reaches them on
// rp1.constructions within one capture, computed the way that file already
// computes it, so there is nothing to gain here and a side effect to lose.
//
// Every arm that cannot read its answer refuses, which is the existing rule on
// this Uplink and the safe direction for a write that queues a spend.
//
// PROVENANCE. Every member here was read out of an ilspycmd disassembly of the
// INSTALLED RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll and the installed Assembly-CSharp. The
// disassembly verifies SHAPE and never VALUE, so every hop is null-safe. What has
// been confirmed against a RUNNING game is that the STOCK channel goes silent off
// the space centre, and that RP-1's config-backed reading does not: the tiers and
// prices on rp1.facilities come off the same two Database tables this file now
// prices from.
