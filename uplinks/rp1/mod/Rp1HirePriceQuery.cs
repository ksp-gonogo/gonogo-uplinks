/*
 * What a head costs, asked the way RP-1 asks it. No compile-time reference to
 * RP0.dll, the same arm's-length reflection pattern as Rp1ScReflection, whose
 * header carries the provenance rules this file follows.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The hire control could state a BOUND on the spend and nothing
 * else, because it had no price to multiply a headcount by. RP-1 has one, and it
 * is not on the wire.
 *
 * RP-1 STATES TWO PRICES AND CHARGES THE LOWER-PROFILE ONE, so this publishes
 * both. Read off the shipped RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll:
 *
 *   THE CHARGE. KCTUtilities.HireStaff is the only funds deduction on the whole
 *   hiring path, and its whole money step is
 *     SpendFunds(Math.Max(0, workerAmount - Applicants) * Database.SettingsSC.HireCost, reason)
 *   SpendFunds runs NO modifier query: its body is a Funding.Instance.AddFunds of
 *   the negative amount. RP-1's Harmony prefix on AddFunds does fire
 *   OnCurrencyModifierQuery, but it adds `value` to the balance BEFORE firing and
 *   never reads the query back, so the event is a notification and not a price.
 *   The charge is therefore the RAW settings value, unmodified, and the same for
 *   both roles.
 *
 *   THE QUOTE. HireStaffProject.IncrementProgress and KCT_GUI.RenderHireFire both
 *   price a head as
 *     -CurrencyUtils.Funds(HiringEngineers|HiringResearchers, -Database.SettingsSC.HireCost)
 *   which DOES run the query. So the number on RP-1's own Hire button, and the
 *   divisor its auto-hire scheduler and its ETA divide by, is leader-modified
 *   while the charge is not.
 *
 * The two differ whenever a hiring-reason leader is active, and RP-1 ships four
 * that qualify. That is an inconsistency in RP-1, not a reading error, and it is
 * not ours to resolve: an operator told only the charge cannot reconcile our
 * figure with RP-1's own screen, and one told only the quote watches a different
 * number leave their balance. Both go on the wire, under names that say which is
 * which.
 *
 * PUBLISHING THE RAW SETTINGS VALUE IS CORRECT HERE, and that is worth saying
 * out loud because it is the shape Rp1EconomyUpkeepQuery exists to forbid. There,
 * the raw per-line costs were a SUBSTITUTE for a figure RP-1 states after its
 * modifiers, so publishing them made the parts disagree with the total. Here the
 * raw value is not a substitute for anything: it is what leaves the balance, and
 * the modified figure is published beside it rather than instead of it.
 *
 * MAIN THREAD, WHICH IS WHY THE QUOTE HALF IS GATED AT ALL. CurrencyUtils.Funds
 * runs CurrencyModifierQueryRP0.RunQuery, which FIRES
 * GameEvents.Modifiers.OnCurrencyModifierQuery at every modifier in the save.
 * This runs inside Rp1ScUplink.CaptureOnMain, which is a main-thread capture, so
 * the thread is right; the cadence is not. Unthrottled it would broadcast twice
 * per physics frame forever, so the two queries are asked only when their answer
 * can have changed.
 *
 * NO COURIER HANDOFF, WHICH IS THE ONE PLACE THIS DEPARTS FROM
 * Rp1EconomyUpkeepQuery. That class needs a volatile publish because its consumer
 * is a DIFFERENT topic's mapper, running on the Courier thread. This one's
 * consumer is the same capture's own payload: the prices are stashed on Rp1ScRaw
 * and cross the seam as plain data with everything else the walk produced, so
 * there is nothing to order and nothing to publish.
 *
 * THE CHANGE-GATE CANNOT BE COPIED FROM THE UPKEEP ONE, and the reason is the
 * interesting part. That gate watches MaintenanceHandler.UpkeepPerDayForDisplay,
 * which RP-1 rebuilds from the same six queries whenever a leader changes, so
 * watching RP-1's own answer is watching the modifiers without asking them. There
 * is no such number for a hire: RP-1 recomputes the price inline every tick and
 * stores it nowhere, and SettingsSC.HireCost does not move when a leader is
 * appointed. A gate on the inputs alone would therefore price once at load and
 * never again, and never see a leader at all.
 *
 * So the gate watches WHO IS LISTENING instead. RP0.Leaders.CurrencyModifier is
 * the only subscriber to OnCurrencyModifierQuery in the whole assembly, and it
 * adds itself in OnRegister and removes itself in OnUnregister, which run with a
 * strategy's activation. Its multiplier is a [Persistent] config field and is NOT
 * scaled by Strategy.Factor, so the set of ACTIVE strategies is the complete
 * statement of what the query will answer. A leader appointed or dismissed
 * therefore re-prices on the very next capture.
 *
 * AND A FLOOR UNDER IT, for the listeners that set cannot describe. Any mod may
 * subscribe to OnCurrencyModifierQuery, and one that did would move the quote
 * with nothing in the gate to show it, so the answer would be wrong forever
 * rather than briefly. The floor re-prices once an in-game hour regardless, which
 * is MaintenanceHandler's own UpdateInterval and so the same staleness the upkeep
 * lines already carry.
