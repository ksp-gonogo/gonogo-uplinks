// RP-1's launch rules, read by reflection and answered as command-gate verdicts.
// No compile-time reference to RP0.dll, same arm's-length pattern as
// Rp1ScReflection, whose header carries the provenance rules this file follows.
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG. `ksp.launch` loads a saved .craft file and hands it to
// FlightDriver.StartWithNewLaunch. Stock is entitled to accept that, because in
// stock a craft file IS a launchable article the moment it is saved, and the
// stock launch tests LaunchPreflight runs all pass. Under RP-1 it is a design:
// the article that flies is a VesselProject a launch complex INTEGRATED over
// weeks and then ROLLED OUT to a pad, and the envelope it flies inside belongs to
// that complex rather than to the pad's tier. Dispatched against a live RP-1
// career the command answered success and put a V-2 on the pad with an empty
// build queue, no launch complex occupied and funds unchanged.
//
// RP-1 blocks its own equivalent: PatchLaunchSiteFacility's prefix refuses
// LaunchSiteFacility.showShipSelection outright while KCT is enabled, so the
// stock pad's craft picker never opens. That patch is a UI hook and there is no
// UI here, which is exactly why this file exists.
//
// WHY THE LIMITS ARE HERE TOO, and not left to LaunchPreflight. Under RP-1 the
// authority on craft mass and size is not the pad. VesselProject
// .MeetsFacilityRequirements measures the vehicle against LaunchComplex.Stats:
// massMax, MassMin, sizeMax, isHumanRated, launch clamps in a hangar, and the
// complex's stocked resources. RP-1 does NOT patch GameVariables
// .GetCraftMassLimit / .GetCraftSizeLimit, it only calls them (in
// PatchEngineersReport and in KCTUtilities.LoadPadData). So stock's pad-tier
// numbers still answer, and under RP-1's own CustomBarnKit config they are
// 18 t / 140 t / unlimited by pad tier, which is a different question from the one
// RP-1 asks. LaunchPreflight keeps running those tests, and this file adds the
// ones the install actually flies by.
//
// RP-1 CAN ANSWER FROM THE SHIP NAME ALONE, and stock cannot, which is the whole
// reason this split falls where it does. The mass, size and human-rating of the
// article are recorded ON the VesselProject when it is integrated, so naming the
// vehicle is enough. Stock has no stored article, so its equivalents need the
// craft file loaded and a ShipTemplate built, which is why they stay in the
// handler where the load already happens.
//
// PROVENANCE. Every member below was read out of an ilspycmd disassembly of the
// INSTALLED RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll (GameData/RP-1/Plugins/RP0.dll on the test
// rig). Nothing here has been seen in a running game; the disassembly verifies
// SHAPE and never VALUE, so every lookup is null-safe per hop and every failure
// to read degrades to Unknown, never to a pass.
//
// THE RULES, as KCT_GUI.RenderBuildListVessel, ProcessRocketLaunch and
// VesselProject.MeetsFacilityRequirements enforce them:
//
//   INTEGRATED: a VesselProject of this name in some LaunchComplex.Warehouse.
//   WITHIN THE COMPLEX'S LIMITS: mass at or under LC.MassMax and at or over
//     LC.MassMin, every axis of the vehicle's size within LC.SizeMax, the complex
//     human-rated if the vehicle is, and no launch clamps on a hangar vehicle.
//   ROLLED OUT (pad complexes only): the complex IsOperational; a
//     ReconRolloutProject in its Recon_Rollout whose associatedID is the
//     vehicle's shipID, whose RRType is Rollout, and which is complete; the
//     LCLaunchPad named by that project's launchPadID present, not destroyed and
//     operational; and no reconditioning running on it. A HANGAR vehicle taxis
//     out: KCT_GUI's hangar branch draws Launch with no rollout at all.
//
// WHAT IS READ, and why each is safe to read:
//
//   SpaceCenterManagement.Instance    static; the scenario module itself
//   .enabledForSave                   plain bool field
//   .KSCs / .LaunchComplexes          [Persistent] lists
//   LaunchComplex.Name/.IsOperational plain fields
//   LaunchComplex.LCType/.MassMax/.SizeMax/.IsHumanRated
//                                     one-line reads of the _lcData struct
//   LaunchComplex.MassMin             LCData.CalcMassMin: floor(massMax * a
//                                     settings fraction), pure
//   .Warehouse / .BuildList           [Persistent] lists of VesselProject
//   .Recon_Rollout / .LaunchPads      [Persistent] lists
//   VesselProject.shipName/.shipID/.mass/.ShipSize/.humanRated/.clampState
//                                     plain [Persistent] fields
//   ReconRolloutProject.associatedID/.RRType/.launchPadID/.progress/.BP
//                                     plain fields, .BP and .progress declared
//                                     on LCOpsProject
//   ReconRolloutProject.IsReversed    pure on both shipped implementations
//   LCLaunchPad.name/.isOperational   plain fields
//   LCLaunchPad.IsDestroyed           reads its own DestructionNode
//
// NOTHING IS INVOKED, and two getters are deliberately gone round:
//
//   VesselProject.GetShipSize() falls back to decompressing the ship node,
//   building a ShipTemplate, WRITING the ShipSize field and re-compressing. The
//   field it writes is [Persistent] and is already populated for a vehicle that
//   has been integrated, so the field is read and a zero vector is treated as a
//   size nobody recorded rather than as a vehicle of no size.
//   LCOpsProject.IsComplete() is `IsReversed ? progress <= 0 : progress >= BP`
//   over fields already read here, so the derivation is written out instead. The
//   rest of that class is off limits for the reason Rp1ScReflection's header
//   gives: GetTimeLeft / GetBuildRate reach LCEfficiency
//   .GetOrCreateEfficiencyForLC, which on a cache miss appends to a [Persistent]
//   list, and a gate must not write to the player's save.
//   LCLaunchPad.State is pure and vouched for there, but it cannot tell a rollout
//   in progress from a finished one (a completed Rollout stays in Recon_Rollout,
//   which is what keeps the pad occupied), so the walk finds the project itself.
//
// WHAT IS NOT REPRODUCED, and why. MeetsFacilityRequirements' last arm is
// ResourcesOK, which compares each of the vehicle's resourceAmounts against the
// complex's resourcesHandled. Its exemption arm needs
// PartResourceLibrary.Instance.GetDefinition(name).density, a KSP read, and this
// assembly deliberately holds no KSP dependency at all, which is what lets every
// rule here be exercised headlessly. So a launch whose complex is short of a fuel
// is permitted here and would be refused by RP-1's own build list. That is the
// one arm of RP-1's launch check this gate does not make.
//
// TWO MORE PLACES THIS IS DELIBERATELY MORE PERMISSIVE THAN RP-1, both so a
// refusal is never something an operator cannot act on:
//
//   VesselProject.AllPartsValid is NOT read. RP-1 hides a vehicle whose parts no
//   longer exist; that is a broken craft rather than an unready one, and stock's
//   own launch path has its own answer for it.
//   A pad's reconditioning is matched on RRType. RP-1's own GetReconditioning
//   compares GetItemName() to the literal "LaunchPad Reconditioning", and that
//   name comes back through Localizer, so RP-1 silently matches nothing outside
//   English. The RRType is the same set in English and the right one everywhere.
