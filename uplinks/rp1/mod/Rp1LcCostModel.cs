// RP-1's price for building and renovating a launch complex, reimplemented,
// because there is nowhere to call it.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, and it is the single largest risk in the
// launch-complex write surface. Every other command in this Uplink invokes an
// RP-1 method that already does the thing: ScrapVessel scraps, ChangeEngineers
// assigns, HireStaff hires. The complex price has no such method. RP-1 computes
// it inline in KCT_GUI.DrawNewLCWindow, interleaved with the GUILayout calls that
// draw it, and hands three doubles to ProcessNewLC as arguments. There is no
// reusable entry point, not even a private one.
//
// So this is arithmetic we own, and a mistake in it does not throw and does not
// refuse: it writes a wrong price onto a construction project, and RP-1 then
// draws that wrong figure out of the career's funds over the following weeks of
// game time. That is why the formula is transcribed one clause at a time with
// RP-1's own structure kept visible rather than simplified into something
// tidier, and why every intermediate is named after what it is rather than after
// RP-1's num/num2/num3.
//
// WHAT IS INVOKED RATHER THAN REIMPLEMENTED, which is as much as could be:
//
//   LCData.GetCostStats(out padCost, out integrationCost, out resourceCost)
//                              the three-way split of a specification's price,
//                              and the whole of the curve over tonnage and size.
//                              Its RETURN is their sum, which is separately what
//                              a modify's oldCost is
//   LCData.ResModifyCost(LCData old)
//                              the price of the resource DIFFERENCE, which is not
//                              symmetric: a reduction is charged at a tenth and
//                              the whole difference then at 0.6 of a fresh tank
//   LCData.GetPadFracLevel()   the tonnage band a pad is built at
//   LCData.MaxPossibleMass / MinPossibleMass / IsMassWithinUpAndDowngradeMargins
//                              the renovation envelope, all three derived from
//                              massOrig alone
//   Database.SettingsSC.AdditionalPadCostMult
//                              what a second and subsequent pad costs, relative
//                              to the first. Ships at 0.5
//
// WHAT HAD TO BE REIMPLEMENTED, and why each is safe to:
//
//   Mathf.Approximately        Unity's, and this assembly references neither
//                              Unity nor KSP on purpose (see the csproj header).
//                              Transcribed exactly, epsilon and all
//   UtilMath.LerpUnclamped / InverseLerp / Clamp
//                              KSP's, three lines between them. The one call site
//                              feeds InverseLerp a value already clamped INSIDE
//                              its own range, so whether KSP's version clamps
//                              cannot change the answer and the reimplementation
//                              cannot diverge on the only input it ever sees
//
// TWO QUIRKS OF RP-1's OWN, both reproduced deliberately, both stated:
//
//   THE 1,000 FLOOR. Any change at all to a complex's tonnage limit forces the
//   pad half of a renovation to at least 1,000 funds, even a change of one tonne
//   and even a reduction. Reproduced.
//
//   THE PAD-COST MULTIPLY THAT LIVES IN A DISPLAY BRANCH. RP-1 applies
//   AdditionalPadCostMult to the pad price it passes to ProcessNewLC from INSIDE
//   an `if (totalCost > 0.0)` block whose purpose is drawing labels, so a
//   renovation that prices at zero or below passes the unmultiplied figure and one
//   that prices at anything passes the multiplied figure. That price reprices the
//   complex's in-flight pad constructions. This file multiplies ALWAYS, which is a
//   deliberate divergence, and the evidence that it is the intended value is
//   RP-1's own LCConstructionProject.ProcessCancel: cancelling the same renovation
//   reprices the same pad constructions and multiplies unconditionally. Matching
//   the cancel path is the only choice that makes queue and cancel agree.
//
// PROVENANCE, in four parts: what was transcribed, which cases are pinned, what is
// still unverified, and what to re-read if RP-1 retunes its prices.
//
// WHAT WAS TRANSCRIBED, and from where. Every clause below came out of an
// ilspycmd disassembly of the INSTALLED RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll, at
// GameData/RP-1/Plugins/RP0.dll, dated 26 Aug 2026. One method:
//
//   RP0.KCT_GUI.DrawNewLCWindow      the whole price, lines 855-895 of the
//                                    decompiled file: the pad half, the 1,000
//                                    floor, the per-metre rate, the integration
//                                    half with its halving and its cap, and the
//                                    resource half
//   RP0.KCT_GUI.ProcessNewLC         which of those figures reaches the project,
//                                    and in what order
//   RP0.LCConstructionProject.ProcessCancel
//                                    the evidence for the pad-multiply divergence
//                                    below
//
// WHICH CASES ARE PINNED, in Rp1LcCostModelTests, one test per clause:
//
//   a new complex is its three costs added                    QuoteNew total
//   growth pays the whole pad difference                      the `>` branch
//   a shrink pays HALF, and is never a refund                 the `* 0.5`
//   every pad past the first scales the pad half              AdditionalPadCostMult
//   ANY tonnage change costs at least 1,000                   the floor, both ways
//   the floor does NOT fire on a size-only renovation         the floor's guard
//   a shrunk envelope costs half an outward move              `costVAB2 < costVAB`
//   a capped growth is NOT halved                             the two do not compose
//   growth is capped at a fresh build's integration cost      the cap
//   height charges twice what width and depth do              the per-axis rates
//   the rate curves over massOrig, not the current limit      Clamp(massOrig,10,50)
//   the hangar has no pad half and a flat 500 rate            the `flag` branch
//   a fractional metre is priced in FLOAT                     AxisDelta
//   adding a resource costs ten times removing it             ResModifyCost
//   an ignored resource is free                               the LCResourceType flags
//   the pad price is ALWAYS multiplied                        the divergence
//
// Each of those sixteen was verified to FAIL against a deliberately broken model:
// nine clauses were mutated out and eight were caught first time. The survivor was
// the metre rate reading massMax instead of massOrig, which passed because every
// case then in the suite held the two equal. That is why the rate test now uses two
// complexes at the SAME current tonnage built at different ones, and it is the
// reason to distrust a suite that has never been shown to fail.
//
// WHAT IS STILL NOT VERIFIED, and it is the important line. Shape is verified and
// VALUE is not. This file and the test fixture were read off the same disassembly,
// so a misreading of GetCostStats or ResModifyCost makes both agree wrongly and
// every test above still passes. Closing that needs a DIFFERENT KIND of check: open
// RP-1's own Modify window on a running career, read the "Modify Cost" it displays,
// and send the same renovation through rp1.complex.modify. Until that has been done
// once, treat every figure here as derived rather than confirmed.
//
// IF RP-1 RETUNES ITS PRICES, this is what to re-read: DrawNewLCWindow's cost block
// first, then LCData.GetCostStats and ResModifyCost (which are invoked, so a retune
// inside them needs no change here), then SpaceCenterSettings.AdditionalPadCostMult
// for the shipped default this file falls back to.
