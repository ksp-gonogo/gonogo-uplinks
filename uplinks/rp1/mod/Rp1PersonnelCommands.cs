// RP-1's staffing write surface: move engineers between a centre's unassigned
// pool and one of its launch complexes.
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG WITHOUT IT. Assignment is the fact the whole space-centre view
// exists to make visible: RP-1 advances a complex's work at
// Engineers / MaxEngineers, so a complex with nobody assigned builds NOTHING
// however many engineers the career has hired, and an engineer assigned to
// nothing draws salary for no work. An operator could read both of those from
// this Uplink and then had to go into the game to act on either.
//
// WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY IS NOT. It does not hire and it does not fire. Hiring
// spends funds, raises the standing payroll and goes through
// KCTUtilities.HireStaff, which bills HireCost per applicant short and moves
// both the centre pool and the complex at once. That is a purchase and belongs
// with the other spend controls, behind an arm-then-confirm and beside a
// balance. Assignment spends nothing at the moment it lands: the engineers are
// already on the books, and all that changes is which complex they work at.
// Keeping the two apart is what lets this command be a single press.
//
// THE MEMBERS IT TOUCHES, each read off the shipped RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll:
//
//   LaunchComplex.Engineers        a plain [Persistent] public int, RP-1's own
//                                  window assigns straight into it
//   LaunchComplex.MaxEngineers     pure arithmetic over the complex's mass and
//                                  size envelope; the ceiling a complex can hold
//   LaunchComplex.IsOperational    false for the whole of a construction or
//                                  modification
//   LaunchComplex.KSC              the owning centre, a plain backing field
//   LCSpaceCenter.UnassignedEngineers
//                                  DERIVED: the centre's hired count minus the
//                                  sum of its complexes' assigned counts, so it
//                                  is what the pool has left rather than a
//                                  stored figure
//   KCTUtilities.ChangeEngineers(LaunchComplex, int)
//                                  the write, via Rp1ComplexWrites for the
//                                  overload hazard
//
// THE CLAMP IS OURS TO DO. ChangeEngineers adds the delta and clamps nothing:
// RP-1's own window works the legal move out first, as
// Math.Min(KSC.UnassignedEngineers, MaxEngineers - Engineers) going up and the
// complex's own count going down. This file asks the same two questions and
// REFUSES rather than clamping, because a clamp reports success for a crew size
// the operator did not ask for.
//
// A NON-OPERATIONAL COMPLEX IS REFUSED, and that is a decision rather than a
// limitation. RP-1 takes a complex's crew off when construction or modification
// starts, records how many it took as engineersToReadd, and puts them back
// itself on completion with ChangeEngineers(lc, min(readd, max, unassigned)).
// That re-add ADDS, so a crew assigned while the work was in flight is still
// there when it lands and the complex can finish above its own maximum. The safe
// direction of a state we would be racing is not to write.
