// What RP-1 will actually charge for a vehicle, and whether the career can bear
// it. No compile-time reference to RP0.dll, the same arm's-length reflection
// pattern as Rp1ScReflection, whose header carries the provenance rules this file
// follows.
//
// WHY IT IS SHARED RATHER THAN COPIED. Two commands now buy a vehicle: repeating
// a design the space centre holds, and starting one from a craft file. The money
// step is the one part of either that cannot be got wrong quietly.
// KCTUtilities.SpendFunds performs NO affordability test: its whole body is a
// Funding.Instance.AddFunds of the negative amount, and the test lives in
// VesselBuildValidator.ProcessFundsChecks, which is the popup-driven half neither
// command calls. So a second copy of this that drifted would not fail a build, it
// would drive a career into negative funds and RP-1 would never say a word.
//
// THE AUTHORITY ON PRICE IS RP-1'S, NOT THE STORED COST.
// CurrencyModifierQueryRP0.RunQuery is what RP-1's own validator asks, and it is
// asked here for the same reason: leaders and strategies modify what a vessel
// purchase actually costs, so the field on the vehicle is a list price rather
// than the charge. The query fires GameEvents.Modifiers.OnCurrencyModifierQuery,
// which is a broadcast, so it is run ONCE per operator press on the main thread,
// exactly where and as often as RP-1's own window runs it. It is never run from a
// gate or a capture.
