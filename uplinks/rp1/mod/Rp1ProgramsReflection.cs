// RP-1's Programs, read by reflection. No compile-time reference to RP0.dll,
// same arm's-length pattern as Rp1ScReflection, whose header carries the
// provenance rules this file follows.
//
// PROVENANCE. Every member below was read out of an ilspycmd disassembly of the
// SHIPPED RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll at
// GameData/RP-1/Plugins/RP0.dll, cross-checked against a live RP-1 career's
// persistent.sfs for the node names Program.Save writes.
//
// EVERY MEMBER INVOKED HERE, rather than read as a field, HAS HAD ITS BODY READ:
//
//   Program.AllRequirementsMet / AllObjectivesMet
//       compiled predicates over RequirementBlock. Every leaf is a state read:
//       ContractRequirement counts ConfiguredContract.CompletedContractsByName,
//       TechRequirement asks ResearchAndDevelopment.GetTechnologyState,
//       FacilityRequirement asks KCTUtilities.GetFacilityLevel, and
//       ProgramRequirement scans ProgramHandler's own two lists. None mutates,
//       none broadcasts, and all four touch KSP statics, which is why this runs
//       in the capture half.
//   Program.CanAccept / CanComplete
//       thin compositions over those predicates and the persisted UT fields.
//   Program.TotalFunding
//       the persisted total when it has one, else baseFunding times
//       HighLogic.CurrentGame.Parameters.Career.FundsGainMultiplier. A read.
//   ProgramHandler.ActiveProgramSlots
//       sums each active Program's own slots field. Pure.
//   ProgramHandler.MaxProgramSlots
//       GameVariables.GetActiveStrategyLimit over the Administration building's
//       level. A read, and the one member here that is absent rather than wrong
//       outside a loaded career.
//   ProgramHandler.Settings.paymentCurves
//       a plain PersistentDictionaryValueTypeKey<string, HermiteCurve>, walked
//       as an IDictionary and never cast. Each curve is enumerated through its
//       own IEnumerable<Key>, whose MoveNext hands back the compiled key array;
//       no evaluation, no compilation, nothing that mutates the curve.
//
// THE FUNDING CURVE, and why it travels as keys. Program.GetFundsAtFrac is
// ProgramHandler.Settings.FundingCurve(fundingCurve).Evaluate(frac) *
// TotalFunding, so a Program's funding is entirely described by a curve NAME
// plus that shared table: twelve Hermite curves in ProgramHandlerSettings.cfg,
// each keyed on fraction-of-duration and valued in cumulative fraction of the
// total, running past 1 because RP-1 keeps paying past the deadline. The table
// is read once per tick onto its own Topic and the per-Program arithmetic is
// reproduced in Rp1ProgramsMath from HermiteCurve.EvaluateBetweenKeys, which is
// a pure basis-function evaluation with no game state in it at all.
//
//   Program.DurationYearsCalc
//       the one member here reproduced rather than called, because its LAST act
//       is CurrencyUtils.Time. Everything before that is arithmetic (1.5 for
//       Slow, 0.75 for Fast, rounded to a quarter year) and is reproduced
//       exactly; the modifier pass is instead recovered from the persisted
//       deadline, which RP-1 rewrites on every funding tick and which therefore
//       already carries it. See Rp1ProgramsMath.DerivedDurationSeconds.
//
// MEMBERS DELIBERATELY NOT CALLED, and why. RP-1 routes a family of display
// figures through CurrencyModifierQueryRP0.RunQuery, whose body FIRES
// GameEvents.Modifiers.OnCurrencyModifierQuery at every modifier in the save.
// That is a thing to run, not a thing to read, and the same fence already
// stands in Rp1EconomyBackend:
//
//   Program.DurationYears, EffectiveDurationYears, RemainingDurationYears
//       all reach CurrencyUtils.Time. The duration in force is instead taken
//       from the persisted deadlineUT, which RP-1 itself recomputes on every
//       funding tick, so a Program a leader has slowed reports its real
//       deadline and never our estimate of one.
//   Program.DisplayConfidenceCost, IsSpeedAllowed, MeetsConfidenceThreshold
//       all reach CurrencyUtils.Conf. The raw per-speed cost is a plain
//       dictionary read and goes on the wire instead; whether the career can
//       afford it is a comparison the client makes against rp1.confidence.
//
// PROGRAM MODIFIERS. RP-1 does not modify its catalogue in place: accepting a
// Program copies the template and runs ApplyProgramModifiers over the copy, and
// the Administration building shows a separate copy with the same overlay
// applied. So a row for a Program not yet accepted has to carry the overlay or
// it quotes funding the operator will not be offered. ProgramModifier.Apply is
// a plain field overlay with a -1 sentinel per field, reproduced by
// Rp1ProgramsMath.Overlay against values read here.
