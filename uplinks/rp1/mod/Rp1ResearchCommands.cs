// Putting a tech node on RP-1's research queue. No compile-time reference to
// RP0.dll, the same arm's-length reflection pattern as Rp1ScReflection, whose
// header carries the provenance rules this file follows.
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG WITHOUT IT. Rp1CareerProjectGate REFUSES career.tech.unlock
// under a managed save, and is right to: core's handler calls
// ResearchAndDevelopment.UnlockProtoTechNode, nothing of RP-1's patches that, so
// the stock write walks straight past RP-1's model and hands the career a node
// it never researched at a price RP-1 never quoted. The refusal names a queue
// the operator is meant to start the job on instead, and until now there was no
// way to start it from here at all: rp1.research published the queue and nothing
// could add to it. This is the command that gate defers to.
//
// THE ROUTE: ResearchProject.Load(ConfigNode), NOT a minted RDTech.
//
// RP-1 itself mints a throwaway RDTech on a bare GameObject inside
// ResearchProject.IncrementProgress (three field writes, Warmup(), destroy) to
// fire an event whose payload has to be one. Copying that and calling the real
// ResearchProject(RDTech) constructor is the obvious route and it is the wrong
// one. That constructor reads FOUR fields off the node and RP-1's mint writes
// THREE: nothing sets `title`, Warmup() sets only partsAssigned/partsPurchased,
// and Start() never runs because Unity schedules it for the next frame and the
// object is destroyed in the same call. The result would persist techName = null
// into the save. RP-1 gets away with three fields because its node is a CARRIER
// FOR AN EVENT; ours would be an ARGUMENT TO A CONSTRUCTOR, a different job with
// a longer read-list. RDTech.techState is private besides, and RP-1 only assigns
// it because it compiles against a publicised Assembly-CSharp.
//
// The deciding criterion is the FAILURE MODE. Load(ConfigNode) fails as a
// CHECKLIST: assert every [Persistent] key is present in the node we author,
// seven, all declared on one class, and Rp1InstalledCompatibilityTests reads
// that list off the SHIPPED assembly rather than trusting this comment. The mint
// fails as a reading-comprehension test over the constructor AND Warmup() AND
// every future edit to either. Prefer the construction path whose failure mode
// can be enumerated.
//
// Load is RP-1's OWN deserialiser and is public. We author a ConfigNode; the
// game reconstructs the object. No RP-1 arithmetic is reproduced here.
//
// THE PROCEDURE, in the order RP0.Harmony.PatchRDTech.Prefix_UnlockTech and
// RDTech.ResearchTech run it between them:
//
//   the preset arm   Prefix_UnlockTech returns TRUE, i.e. lets the stock unlock
//                    proceed, unless GeneralSettings.Enabled, .TechUnlockTimes
//                    and .BuildTimes all hold. In a save where they do not, a
//                    queued project is a state RP-1's own patch declines to
//                    produce, so this refuses rather than enqueuing one
//   the tree         the ProtoTechNode for the techID, off
//                    AssetBase.RnDTechTree.GetTreeTechs()
//   already done     GetTechnologyState == Available, which is what UnlockTech
//                    sets and therefore means RESEARCHED here
//   already queued   SpaceCenterManagement.TechListHas, asked BEFORE the charge,
//                    or a double press double-spends
//   affordability    CurrencyModifierQueryRP0.RunQuery(RnDTechResearch, ...)
//                    .CanAfford(Science), which is exactly what the stock
//                    CurrencyModifierQuery.RunQuery inside ResearchTech BECOMES
//                    under RP-1's PatchCMQ prefix
//   the ceiling      GameVariables.GetScienceCostLimit at the R&D building's
//                    normalised level, in ResearchTech's own order, after
//                    affordability and before the charge
//   the charge       ResearchAndDevelopment.Instance.AddScience(-cost,
//                    RnDTechResearch), a method RP-1 prefixes with its own body.
//                    The charge happens AT ENQUEUE, not on completion
//   the enlistment   TechList.Add, UpdateBuildRate(Count - 1),
//                    KCTUtilities.AddNodePartsToExperimental
//
// ONE DEPARTURE FROM THAT ORDER, and it is within the same route rather than a
// change of it: the ResearchProject is CONSTRUCTED before the science is
// charged, not after. Nothing in constructing it touches the game (the
// parameterless constructor sets three fields, Load parses the node we just
// wrote), so moving it above the charge costs nothing and means the only steps
// between money leaving and the node being queued are Add and two calls that
// cannot fail on their own account. The unavoidable residue is stated where it
// happens: if the Add throws, the science is gone and the queue is empty, and
// the refusal says so rather than reading as "nothing happened".
//
// TWO THINGS THE ROUTE MAKES US AUTHOR, and both are read from the LIVE game
// rather than from the tree asset:
//
//   state   ResearchAndDevelopment.GetTechnologyState(techID) is the player's
//           state. The ProtoTechNode hanging off AssetBase.RnDTechTree carries
//           the CONFIG DEFAULT and would be a different question answered
//           confidently. Under this route the field is a decision we make, which
//           is the advantage of the route: it can be sourced correctly
//   parts    the live ProtoTechNode's partsPurchased, written out as the `part`
//           values ProtoTechNode(ConfigNode) reads back. RP-1's own constructor
//           reaches the same list through RDTech.Start's alias of it
//
// WHAT THE `part` VALUES DO AND DO NOT REPRODUCE. RP-1's constructor ALIASES the
// live parts list, so a part bought while the node sits in the queue is still on
// the project's ProtoNode when it completes. Ours is a fresh list holding the
// same names, so a purchase made after this command runs is not on it. That is
// not a divergence from RP-1: ResearchProject.Load is RP-1's own load path, it
// builds `new ProtoTechNode(node.GetNode("ProtoNode"))` every time, and so any
// queued project that has survived one save/load in a normal game is already
// detached exactly this way. Reproducing the alias would give this command an
// object identity RP-1's own round-trip does not have.
//
// THE ONE GAP, MEASURED AND ACCEPTED. SCMEvents.OnTechQueued is an
// EventData<RDTech> and this route has no RDTech to fire it with. It is fired in
// exactly one place in the shipped RP0.dll and RP-1 SUBSCRIBES TO IT NOWHERE: it
// is a public extension point for third parties. So a third-party listener will
// NOT hear a research queued by this command. Bounded, and named here rather
// than left to be discovered.
//
// THE BALANCE IS ALREADY ON THE WIRE, which is what lets a control that spends
// science show it: core publishes career.status.economy.science (the banked
// balance, off ResearchAndDevelopment.Science) and career.status.tech.nodes[]
// with each node's scienceCost and live unlocked flag. The cost published there
// is the same integer this command charges, because RP-1 neither re-prices a
// node nor stores a cost of its own: ResearchProject.scienceCost is assigned
// straight from the tree. A refusal carries both figures again as a LimitBreach,
// for the case where the operator's view was stale.
//
// WHAT IS READ, and why each is safe:
//
//   SpaceCenterManagement.Instance / .enabledForSave
//                                    the same two reads Rp1ScReflection opens
//                                    with, vouched for there
//   SpaceCenterManagement.TechList   the queue Rp1ScReflection already walks
//   PresetManager.Instance / .ActivePreset / KCT_Preset.GeneralSettings
//                                    plain fields and one auto-property
//   KCT_Preset_General.Enabled / .TechUnlockTimes / .BuildTimes
//                                    plain public bools
//   Database.TechNodePeriods         public static readonly, a
//                                    Dictionary<string, TechPeriod> underneath,
//                                    walked as a bare IEnumerable so no cast to
//                                    a generic from another assembly is taken
//   TechPeriod.startYear / .endYear  plain ints; they feed YearBasedRateMult and
//                                    therefore the RATE, so a wrong pair makes a
//                                    node research at the wrong speed silently.
//                                    A missing key leaves them at 0, which is
//                                    what RP-1's own TryGetValue miss does
