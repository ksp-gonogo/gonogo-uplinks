// Reflection-only bridge to RP-1's space-centre model. No compile-time reference
// to the RP-0 plugin (RP0.dll, CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0): every member is reached by
// runtime reflection, the same arm's-length pattern as Rp1AvionicsReflection.
//
// PROVENANCE. Member names are RESOLVED, not guessed: every one below was read
// out of an ilspycmd disassembly of the SHIPPED RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll
// (GameData/RP-1/Plugins/RP0.dll from the published RP-1-v4.6.0.0.zip, whose
// source tag is c96fda7). One version across the Uplink now: the standalone
// GonogoAvionicsUplink was locked against v4.5.0.0 and the two were free to
// disagree, which is part of why it was folded in. Nothing here has been seen
// in a running game, because there is no RP-1 install on this machine or the
// test rig; the disassembly verifies SHAPE and never VALUE, so every lookup is
// null-safe per hop and degrades to absent rather than to a default that looks
// like a reading.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT CALLED, and why it is worth the trouble:
//
//   LaunchComplex.Efficiency / .EfficiencySource, LCOpsProject.GetTimeLeft() /
//   .GetBuildRate() / .GetTimeLeftEst(), VesselProject.BuildRate,
//   ResearchProject.BuildRate / .TimeLeft
//
// all reach LCEfficiency.GetOrCreateEfficiencyForLC, which on a cache MISS
// constructs an LCEfficiency, appends it to a [Persistent] list and calls
// RefreshAllCaches(). A telemetry read must not write to the player's save. The
// underlying data is reachable read-only, so nothing is lost by going round
// them: SpaceCenterManagement.LCToEfficiency is a public field and this file
// looks the launch complex up in it directly, and the rates come off the private
// backing fields the getters would otherwise populate. See Rp1ScMath for the
// arithmetic those two facts make possible.
//
// LCOpsProject.GetTimeLeftEstAll() is out for a second reason on top of the
// first: it mutates three shared static scratch lists on RP-1's own type.
//
// The construction projects are out for their own reasons, which is why none of
//
//   ConstructionProject.GetBuildRate() / .GetTimeLeft() / .GetFractionComplete()
//   / .RemainingCost / .RushMultiplier / .KSC, FacilityUpgradeProject
//   .GetItemName(), PadConstructionProject.LC / .GetItemName()
//
// is called either. GetBuildRate writes _buildRate and reaches .KSC, which
// memoises a centre found by walking the whole roster; RemainingCost runs a
// CurrencyModifierQueryRP0 that broadcasts to every modifier in the save;
// RushMultiplier evaluates a HermiteCurve from a separate assembly whose body
// could not be read, so the throttle is published and the cost multiplier it
// buys is not; PadConstructionProject.LC memoises the same way GetBuildRate's
// centre does; and the two GetItemName overrides localise a facility name and
// walk to the complex respectively, where the stored `name` field answers
// already.
//
// WHAT IS CALLED, each with its body read on the shipped assembly:
//
//   LCLaunchPad.State          pure; reads its own destruction ConfigNode, its
//                              own isOperational, and its complex's rollout list
//   LaunchComplex.MaxEngineers pure arithmetic over massMax/sizeMax/isHumanRated
//   LaunchComplex.Rate         a plain `=> _rate` backing-field read
//   LCEfficiency.Efficiency    a plain `=> _efficiency` backing-field read
//   LCEfficiency.MaxEfficiency a plain `=> _MaxEfficiency` static read
//   LCEfficiency.PredictWeightedEfficiency
//                              pure: reads its own efficiency and some statics,
//                              evaluates a settings curve, writes only locals
//                              and its out parameter
//   LCOpsProject.IsBlocking / .IsReversed
//                              pure on both shipped implementations
//                              (ReconRolloutProject switches on RRType,
//                              VesselRepairProject inherits the base constants)
//
// ONE CALL REACHES CODE THIS FILE COULD NOT READ, and it is fenced accordingly.
// LCSpaceCenter.AssociatedGroundStation calls KSCSwitcherInterop
// .GetGroundStationForKSC, whose body IS read (it returns null outright when
// KSCSwitcher is absent, and memoises otherwise) but which then invokes
// KSCSwitcher's own GetSiteByName, and KSCSwitcher is not installed anywhere
// reachable. So it is called at most ONCE per centre name, its result memoised
// here as well, and a throw degrades that one field to absent.
