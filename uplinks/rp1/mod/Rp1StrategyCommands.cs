// Committing to a strategy from outside the Administration Building.
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG. On a live RP-1 career the console lists 97 strategies (60
// leader configs plus 37 generated program ones) and can appoint NONE of them:
// every entry carries canActivate absent with "KSP answers this only while the
// Administration Building is open". That is honest, and it is the whole feature
// missing. Stock's Strategy.CanBeActivated dereferences Administration.Instance
// in its first statement, Strategy.Activate calls CanBeActivated, so both throw
// with the screen shut.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD. StrategyRP0.ActivateOverride is gate-plus-procedure
// and nothing else, and PerformActivate is public, non-virtual and never asks
// CanBeActivated. So we ask the arms that do not need the screen, then call the
// procedure. The UI-dependent arm is never asked rather than answered, and
// nothing here reproduces a rule the game would have applied.
//
// See Rp1StrategyWrites for the rule this obeys, the reason the program half is
// hoisted rather than bypassed, and the provenance of every member.
//
// THE TWO ARMS WE CANNOT ASK, and why that is honest rather than a hole:
//
//   Arm 1 is the concurrent-strategy cap, and it is the one the screen owns.
//   Under RP-1 it is a DEAD ARM for leaders: PatchStrategy zeroes the count
//   stock compares, precisely so leaders are exempt, and the real cap for
//   programs lives at arm 8 which we DO ask. Under stock it is a live rule we
//   cannot evaluate, so a stock career refuses with that named as the reason
//   rather than being guessed at.
//
//   Arm 3 is the commit-level ceiling. GameVariables.GetStrategyCommitRange is
//   the same method Administration.Start reads it from and is public and
//   VIRTUAL, so calling through GameVariables.Instance inherits a retiering
//   mod's override where reimplementing the thresholds would not. We ask it.
//
// EVERY OTHER ARM IS THE GAME'S OWN. Conflicts, the three affordability checks,
// the reputation floor, the strategy's own CanActivate and each effect's
// CanActivate are all invoked on the live objects. Arm 9 in particular executes
// third-party code, so a throw there refuses rather than proceeding: an
// unanswerable question leaves the commitment unmade.
