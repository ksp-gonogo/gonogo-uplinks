// Buying every tooling a ship is missing, and reshaping a part to tooling already
// owned. Two verbs of DIFFERENT KINDS, which is the thing to keep hold of.
//
// PROVENANCE. Both sequences were read out of an ilspycmd disassembly of the
// SHIPPED RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll, from RP0.ToolingGUI and RP0.ToolingPartResizer:
// the window an operator would otherwise be using.
//
// TOOL ALL IS A PURCHASE. RP-1's own order, replicated:
//
//   1  collect every ModuleTooling on the editor ship where !IsUnlocked()
//   2  price it, and check the career can afford it
//   3  ModuleTooling.PurchaseToolingBatch(parts), which charges through
//      UnlockCreditHandler inside a CareerEventScope
//   4  fire GameEvents.onEditorShipModified so the editor re-prices the vessel
//
// Step 2's PRICE COMES OFF A CACHED FIELD, and the obvious route is a trap.
// RP-1's window prices the ship with ToolingGUI.GetUntooledPartsAndCost, which
// calls PurchaseToolingBatch(parts, isSimulation: true) -- and that "simulation"
// saves the tooling database to a ConfigNode, PERFORMS EVERY PURCHASE FOR REAL,
// then reloads from the node. One throw between the save and the reload leaves the
// career's tooling bought. Nothing here calls it. SpaceCenterManagement
// .EditorToolingCosts is the same number, already deduplicated, as a plain field.
//
// Step 4 is not decoration. The untooled surcharge rides IPartCostModifier, so a
// vessel that has just been tooled is still quoting its old price until the editor
// recomputes, and the thing that makes it recompute is that event. RP-1 fires it
// for the same reason.
//
// REFIT IS AN EDIT, and must not wear the purchase's clothes. It spends nothing
// and writes nothing to the tooling database: ToolingPartResizer.Resize reshapes a
// part so that it fits tooling the career ALREADY owns. That is the other way of
// closing the gap the channel reports, and it is a change to the craft rather than
// to the career.
//
// Its two reaches beyond the part named, both of which RP-1 discloses only
// afterwards in a screen message:
//
//   symmetry counterparts are resized too   (CountCounterparts)
//   the tank material is applied to a GROUP (ApplyRfTypeToGroup)
//
// This surface says them FIRST instead: rp1.tooling[].symmetryCounterparts carries
// the count so a control can warn before the press, and the refusal below names
// the part when it cannot be reshaped at all.
//
// AND IT DOES NOT READ WHICH PANEL IS OPEN. RP-1's control takes its target from
// ToolingPartResizer.PawTarget(), which returns the part whose action window the
// player has open and null when zero or several are. Resize itself takes a Part.
// That distinction is the whole of why this command names a craft id: a verb whose
// subject depends on a panel being open is one an operator at another console
// cannot use, which is the rule the window ratchet exists to hold.
