// RP-1's tooling, read by reflection. Same arm's-length pattern as
// Rp1ScReflection, whose header carries the provenance rules this file follows.
//
// PROVENANCE. Every member below was read out of an ilspycmd disassembly of the
// SHIPPED RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll, and the KSP members out of the shipped
// Assembly-CSharp.dll.
//
// WHAT TOOLING IS, because the wire shape only makes sense against it. RP-1 keeps
// a CAREER-GLOBAL database keyed on a tooling TYPE string and an ordered tuple of
// float parameters, held as a tree one level deep per parameter. It is not
// per-part, not per-variant and not per-configuration: two parts of different
// sizes share one tooling whenever their type matches and every parameter is
// within FOUR PERCENT, so tooling one part can leave a neighbour free.
//
// THE PRICE COMES OFF A CACHED FIELD, AND THE OBVIOUS ROUTE IS A TRAP.
// SpaceCenterManagement.EditorToolingCosts is a public static double that RP-1
// keeps current from its own editor-ship-modified handler, and it already holds
// the deduplicated Tool-All total. The route RP-1's own window takes is
// ToolingGUI.GetUntooledPartsAndCost, which calls
// ModuleTooling.PurchaseToolingBatch(parts, isSimulation: true) -- and that
// "simulation" SAVES the tooling database to a ConfigNode, PERFORMS EVERY
// PURCHASE FOR REAL, then reloads from the node. One throw between the save and
// the reload leaves the career's tooling bought. It is a mutation wearing a
// simulation's name and nothing here may call it. The cached field is not a
// convenience, it is the only safe reading of that number.
//
// A NAIVE SUM IS NOT THE SAME NUMBER, which is why RP-1 simulates at all:
// purchasing one part's tooling can unlock a second part for free, so adding up
// each part's own cost OVERSTATES the total. Both figures are published and they
// are different questions, so they are named differently on the wire.
//
// TWO THINGS THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT PUBLISH, each because there is no uniform
// way to read it rather than because it was not wanted:
//
//   the numeric parameter TUPLE
//       ModuleTooling exposes no accessor for it. Every concrete subclass
//       computes its own tuple inside its own cost function: the DiamLen family
//       uses (diameter, length) and ModuleToolingProcAvionics uses
//       (controllableMass, diameter, length) off a member that is private. What
//       IS uniform is GetToolingParameterInfo(), a virtual whose ProcAvionics
//       override composes the mass onto the base rendering, so the STRING is
//       variable-length by construction and is the producer's own. Reproducing
//       the tuple would mean mirroring RP-1's type hierarchy and would silently
//       misreport the day a subclass adds a parameter.
//   the tooling LEVEL, N of M
//       same cause. ToolingDatabase.GetToolingLevel is public and would answer it,
//       but only if handed the RIGHT tuple, and asking it with the two-parameter
//       tuple against a three-parameter type returns a confidently wrong level.
//       The base class offers only IsUnlocked(). The economics of a PARTIAL
//       tooling are still visible, in the number that matters: GetToolingCost
//       adds the diameter component only at level zero, so a part that is half
//       tooled quotes a lower price to finish.
//
// MEMBERS DELIBERATELY NOT CALLED, and why:
//
//   ToolingGUI.GetUntooledPartsAndCost, ModuleTooling.PurchaseToolingBatch
//       see above. The pricing path is a write.
//   ModuleTooling.ToolingEvent
//       the per-part PAW button. It purchases one part's tooling through the
//       game's own event plumbing; the command path constructs its own list.
//   ToolingPartResizer.PawTarget
//       reads which part-action window the player has open. That is the GUI's
//       dependency and not the API's: Resize takes a Part, so a command addresses
//       a part itself and never reads panel state. Keeping those apart is the
//       whole point of the window ratchet.
