// Enrolling a crew on a training, and RP-1's TWO ways out of one.
//
// PROVENANCE. Every sequence below was read out of an ilspycmd disassembly of the
// SHIPPED RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll, from RP0.Crew.TrainingGUI: the screen an
// operator would otherwise be using. No compile-time reference to RP0.dll, the
// same arm's-length reflection pattern as the rest of this Uplink.
//
// ENROL IS ONE ACT, NOT TWO, and that is RP-1's shape rather than a simplification
// of it. TrainingGUI builds a course from a template, collects students into it,
// and only calls TrainingCourses.Add once StartCourse has returned true. An
// enrolled-but-unstarted course is never persisted, so there is no course to enrol
// into and the command names a template and a crew together.
//
// The order below is TrainingGUI's own, and the order matters in one place:
// StartCourse GROUNDS every student (SetInactive for 120% of the base time), so
// anything that can fail is asked before it, and the list's Add is resolved before
// it too. A course that started and then could not be added to the roster would
// leave kerbals grounded against nothing.
//
//   1  the template, by id, off CrewHandler.TrainingTemplates
//   2  the students, by name, off HighLogic.CurrentGame.CrewRoster
//   3  new TrainingCourse(template)
//   4  ACLevelRequirement vs KCTUtilities.GetFacilityLevel(AstronautComplex)
//   5  the named crew's size against SeatMin and SeatMax
//   6  MeetsStudentReqs, then AddStudent, per kerbal
//   7  StartCourse
//   8  TrainingCourses.Add
//   9  MaintenanceHandler.ScheduleMaintenanceUpdate
//
// Steps 1-6 touch nothing RP-1 keeps: the course is a local object until step 8,
// and AddStudent only appends to its own list. So a refusal anywhere before step 7
// leaves the career exactly as it was.
//
// THE AC GATE IS ASKED HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE, which is the deliberate other half
// of the catalogue's refusal to publish it. TrainingTemplate.ACLevelRequirement
// reaches TrainingDatabase.GetACRequirement, which clears and refills a shared
// static tracker; a channel read taken every tick must not do that, and an
// operator press is exactly when RP-1's own screen does it. Note StartCourse
// itself does NOT check the tier: only the UI does, so declining to ask would
// quietly permit a course RP-1 would not offer.
//
// THE TWO WAYS OUT, and why the brief's AbortCourse is not either of them.
// AbortCourse has ONE caller in the whole assembly, CrewHandler.RemovePartCourses,
// the path that withdraws a template whose tech went away. It also returns
// immediately when the course has not started, and it does not remove the course
// from the roster. RP-1's own operator-facing controls are:
//
//   Cancel   drawn when SeatMin > 1, because removing one student would strand
//            the rest below the minimum. TrainingGUI.CancelCourse runs
//            CompleteCourse() then TrainingCourses.Remove(course). CompleteCourse
//            on a course whose Completed flag is still false SHORT-CIRCUITS its
//            entire reward block (`if (Completed && _template != null)`) and falls
//            through to one loop setting every student inactive = false. So it
//            un-grounds the crew and grants nothing, which is precisely what
//            RP-1's confirmation warns about: "they will lose any retirement
//            benefit of the training as well."
//   Remove   drawn otherwise. TrainingGUI.LeaveCourse runs
//            course.RemoveStudent(student), then removes the course from the
//            roster if that emptied it.
//
// ONE GUARD RP-1 DOES NOT NEED AND THIS DOES. Both leave paths refuse a course
// whose Completed flag is already true. RP-1's screen cannot reach one, because a
// completed course is off the roster by the time it draws again; a command can be
// sent at any moment, and CompleteCourse on a completed course runs the whole
// reward path a second time and spawns a PopupDialog from a code path nobody
// opened a screen for.
