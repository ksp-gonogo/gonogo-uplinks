// The rest of RP-1's build-queue write surface: move a finished vehicle to a
// pad, bring it back, scrap it, and put a launch complex into rush mode. Same
// arm's-length reflection as Rp1BuildCommands, whose header carries the
// provenance rules and the money argument this file inherits.
//
// WHAT WAS STILL WRONG after the repeat-build command shipped. An operator could
// ask a complex to integrate another vehicle and then could not do a single
// thing with the vehicle that came out: not move it to a pad, not change their
// mind, not correct a queue they had filled by mistake. Every one of those is
// reachable in RP-1's own window and none of them was reachable from here.
//
// THE MONEY, and why this file has no currency query while Rp1BuildCommands does.
// Each of the four was checked against the shipped disassembly separately rather
// than assumed to behave like a purchase, and none of them is one:
//
//   ROLL OUT is billed AS IT PROGRESSES and RP-1 polices it itself.
//   ReconRolloutProject's constructor sets cost from Formula.GetRolloutCost and
//   touches Funding not at all. The charge happens in
//   LCOpsProject.IncrementProgress, which per tick runs its OWN
//   CurrencyModifierQueryRP0 for that tick's slice and, when the career cannot
//   cover it, THROTTLES progress to CurrencyUtils.GetAffordableFundsFraction and
//   spends only that. So a rollout cannot overdraw a career, which is the exact
//   opposite of KCTUtilities.SpendFunds, and an up-front affordability check here
//   would refuse rollouts RP-1 itself would happily start and simply run slowly.
//
//   ROLL BACK costs nothing at all: SwitchDirection flips RRType and reschedules
//   maintenance. A Rollback's HasCost is false, so the reverse trip is free.
//
//   SCRAP PAYS THE CAREER. KCTUtilities.ScrapVessel removes the vehicle from
//   whichever list holds it and then AddFunds(GetTotalCost(), VesselPurchase): a
//   full refund, integrating or finished alike. Nothing can be short of funds.
//
//   RUSH spends nothing when it is set. It raises Database.SettingsSC's rate and
//   SALARY multipliers, so the cost arrives later as payroll, and on a pad
//   complex it also stops the complex gaining efficiency. Worth telling an
//   operator, and not an affordability question.
//
// WHAT IS READ, beyond the reads Rp1BuildCommands already vouches for:
//
//   LaunchComplex.LCType             a property over the [Persistent] LCData
//   LaunchComplex.LaunchPads         [Persistent] list of LCLaunchPad
//   LaunchComplex.Recon_Rollout      [Persistent] list of ReconRolloutProject
//   LaunchComplex.ID                 the complex's own Guid, and what
//                                    rp1.complexes[].lcId publishes
//   LCLaunchPad.name/.State          State is a PROPERTY and not a cheap one:
//                                    it walks the complex's Recon_Rollout and
//                                    reads its own destruction ConfigNode. Pure,
//                                    and read once per candidate pad rather than
//                                    per refusal
//   ReconRolloutProject.associatedID/.RRType/.launchPadID
//                                    the three fields that say which vehicle an
//                                    operation is moving and which way
//   VesselProject.shipID             the id an operation's associatedID is
//                                    stamped from, which is NOT the
//                                    KCTPersistentID a command addresses
//   VesselProject.AllPartsValid      a memoising property over AreAllPartsValid
//
// WHAT IS INVOKED, each of them a write RP-1 itself performs on the same click:
//
//   new ReconRolloutProject(vp, Rollout, vp.shipID.ToString(), padName)
//                                    FOUR parameters, the last defaulted. A
//                                    reflected invoke applies no defaults, so
//                                    all four are passed
//   LCLaunchPad.HasVesselWaitingToBeLaunched(out Vessel)
//                                    the only check that catches a pad which
//                                    reads Free and has a craft sitting on it
//                                    in PRELAUNCH
//   VesselProject.MeetsFacilityRequirements(List<string>)
//   ReconRolloutProject.SwitchDirection()
//   LaunchComplex.Recon_Rollout.Add(project)
//   KCTUtilities.ScrapVessel(vp)
//   KCTUtilities.ChangeEngineers(LaunchComplex, 0)
//                                    what RP-1's own rush toggle calls to make
//                                    the change take: it fires
//                                    SCMEvents.OnPersonnelChange, reschedules
//                                    maintenance and recalculates the complex's
//                                    build rates. Resolved by first-parameter
//                                    TYPE, because the LCSpaceCenter overload has
//                                    the same arity and moving a centre's pool
//                                    instead would be silent
//
// TWO FIELDS ARE WRITTEN DIRECTLY, because no RP-1 method sets them:
//   VesselProject.launchSiteIndex    the pad the vehicle is bound for, by index
//                                    into the complex's LaunchPads. RP-1's own
//                                    rollout sets this and the pad name together,
//                                    and a rollout with only the name set leaves
//                                    the warehouse row resolving the WRONG pad
//   LaunchComplex.IsRushing          a plain [Persistent] bool, exactly what
//                                    RP-1's own toggle assigns
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE. Recovery, air-launch mount and unmount, and reconditioning.
// The first is a flight-scene action (see Rp1BuildCommands' header), and the
// other two belong to a hangar rather than a pad complex, which is a separate
// operation with its own preconditions rather than a flag on this one.
//
// PROVENANCE. Every member named above was read out of an ilspycmd disassembly
// of the INSTALLED RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll. The disassembly verifies SHAPE and
// never VALUE: nothing here has been exercised against a running game, so every
// hop is null-safe and every failure to read refuses the command rather than
// guessing at it.
