// Warping to the next thing RP-1 is waiting for.
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG WITHOUT IT. RP-1's whole career loop is waiting: a vehicle
// integrates for weeks, a tech node researches for months, a complex renovates.
// An operator could read every one of those and its ETA from this Uplink, and
// then had to step the warp ladder by hand and watch for the moment to stop.
// RP-1 does it properly and stops on the exact frame; a human stepping a ladder
// does not.
//
// ONE COMMAND, NOT THREE, and both omissions are decisions worth reading.
//
// There is no rp1.warp.stop, because RP-1's controller stops ITSELF: its
// FixedUpdate reads TimeWarp.CurrentRateIndex and a zero branches straight to
// DestroyGameObject (IL_002c `brtrue.s IL_003f`, else IL_002f-IL_003e). So
// core's own time.setWarpIndex(0) already ends an RP-1 warp, the WarpControl
// widget's existing "1x" button already sends it, and a second command would be
// two controls doing one thing with the operator left to guess which one RP-1
// respects. It respects both. Checked at IL rather than in the decompiler
// precisely because it is being used to REMOVE scope.
//
// There is no rp1.warp.toFundTarget either, and that one was BUILT and then
// removed. RP-1 should not be controlling warp on the app's behalf: the thing
// the command achieved is a stop at a balance, and a SCET threshold on
// career.status/economy.funds is that same stop, decided inside the simulation
// on the tick the balance is reached, in the operator's own alarm list rather
// than under a mod's control. RP-1's client asks for that alarm now (see
// client/src/WarpTargets/FundTarget.tsx), and rp1.fundTarget.set went with it:
// the two were one controller wearing two names. Nothing was stranded. RP-1's
// own Maintenance screen still carries the whole feature, a "Warp to Fund
// Target" button on MaintenanceGUI.RenderSummaryTab whose dialog offers both
// "Yes, Warp" and "Add Warp Target".
//
// WARP-TO-COMPLETE STAYS, and its replacement does not exist: nothing publishes
// "the next project to finish" as an instant a threshold could be armed against.
// The candidates live across rp1.buildQueue, rp1.constructions, rp1.research and
// rp1.training, and a dotted path cannot index a list.
//
// WHAT IS INVOKED:
//
//   KCTWarpController.Create(ISpaceCenterProject)
//                                    ARITY ONE, and its argument is nullable with
//                                    a MEANING: null means "the next thing to
//                                    finish", anything else means that project.
//                                    RP-1's own warp-to-complete button passes
//                                    null, and its per-project buttons pass the
//                                    project
//   KCTUtilities.GetNextThingToFinish()
//                                    asked BEFORE Create, which is the whole of
//                                    the guard below
//
// RP-1's OWN Create THROWS on an empty career, and this is the finding that shapes
// the first command. Create assigns the target and then logs
// `warpTarget.GetItemName()` with no null check, and GetNextThingToFinish returns
// null both when ActiveSC is null and when nothing anywhere is in progress. RP-1
// never hits it because its button is drawn inside a branch that already has a
// non-null next-thing (the else arm renders "No Active Projects"), so the
// NullReferenceException is latent and reachable only by a caller that does not
// check. Worse, Create has already done `new GameObject` and `AddComponent` by
// then, so the throw leaves a KCTWarpController attached with a null target.
// Asking GetNextThingToFinish ourselves first is not defensive tidiness, it is the
// difference between a refusal and a wrecked scene.
//
// THE SCENE MATTERS, and RP-1 says so twice. Its controller's FixedUpdate returns
// early unless the scene is flight, the space centre or the tracking station, and
// its own buttons are drawn only outside the editor. A warp started anywhere else
// would create a controller that never ticks: it would set a warp rate and then
// never step it down, which is worse than not warping at all because it overshoots
// the thing it was aimed at. Declared as a REQUIREMENT so the control is dark with
// its reason rather than answering a press with a wasted warp.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE. Warping to a NAMED project, which RP-1 offers a button for on
// every row of its build list. Not because it is hard (it is the same Create call
// with the project instead of null) but because it is a different act: "warp until
// this particular thing is done" needs the thing addressed on the wire, and the
// projects an operator would name are spread across rp1.buildQueue,
// rp1.constructions, rp1.research and rp1.training with four different id shapes.
// Worth doing and not worth guessing at.
//
// PROVENANCE. Every member named above was read out of an ilspycmd disassembly of
// the INSTALLED RP-1 v4.6.0.0 RP0.dll, and the self-destruct on rate zero
// additionally out of its IL. The disassembly verifies SHAPE and never VALUE:
// nothing here has been exercised against a running game, so every hop is
// null-safe and every failure to read refuses the command rather than guessing at
// it.
