 * runtime registry, so `wrapTopicPayload` retypes `subLatitude`, `altitude`,
 * every sensor altitude and the whole nested `trackColor` before a widget sees
 * them. The mismatch was not cosmetic: `subLatitude.toFixed(2)` threw
 * `toFixed is not a function` the moment SCANsat reported a single scanning
 * vessel, and the footprint arithmetic produced `NaN` coordinates rather than
 * throwing, so the minimap drew nothing and said nothing.
 *
 * Found by the first fed render of this widget through the Uplink render
 * harness, which is what a fed render is for: no test in this package feeds a
 * scanning vessel in its WIRE shape, so every one of them passed.
