// mod/GonogoTestFlightUplink/TestFlightReliabilityMap.cs
// Pure (KSP-free) mapper: per-engine reflection reads -> the shared reliability
// wire shape (ReliabilitySummary / ReliabilityPartEntry, defined in
// Sitrep.Contract). It builds the contract POCOs directly and the backend calls
// it, rather than each writing its own copy of the mapping: the two copies that
// used to exist were a corroborating pair, both green while the reflection layer
// underneath them returned nothing.
