// mod/GonogoTestFlightUplink/TestFlightUplink.cs
// The [SitrepUplink("testflight")] uplink: a client-less reliability PROVIDER.
// It declares NO channels of its own - TestFlight's presence is conveyed by
// system.uplinks health (Health() below) and by reliability.summary.source ==
// "testflight" once its provider wins the election, so a dedicated
// testflight.available topic (and a client package to register it) would be
// pure overhead for a provider with no widget.
//
// It does NOT declare the "reliability" capability or the reliability.* channels
// - the shared reliability core registrar owns those (mirroring how a core
// capability registrar owns a capability while a mod uplink only registers a
// provider). Registering the provider IS the election gate, done in Register
// (the capability is declared in the earlier discovery pass), gated on the
// TestFlight probe.
